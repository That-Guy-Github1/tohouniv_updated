 lunar_children_of_tsukuyomi_aspect_v2: "Children of Tsukuyomi"
 desc_lunar_children_of_tsukuyomi_aspect_v2: "The Lunarians are at first the close relatives of Lord Tsukuyomi, the Moon God of the Shintoistic faith.

They will be able to scout the area before engagement, and provide us with a value information about the shortest route available! We won't be able to create a scout party for every single unit of our army, but, we will manage to do so for our marines!"

What if we will build a whole Dance Hall for her and her troops? Surely, Iku will be glad to receive such favor from us! Not to mention, it will improve troops morale too!

The maximum that we can afford is to equip one regiment of infantrymen with these elite weapons."

 HVR_stormbringer_title: "Stormbringers"
 HVR_stormbringer_desc: "The art of shipbuilding in Gensokyo and Asia is at a rather backward level. We need new ideas that will allow us to create a ship of a fundamentally new level! A ship that would allow us to carry out quick sea sorties. A ship that has the ability to stand up for itself, while having the ability to transport our marines. Perhaps people from Europe are much more skilled in this matter. We must visit these people, establish relations with them!

 HVR_making_our_resort_even_better_title: "Making our Resort even Better!"
 HVR_making_our_resort_even_better_desc: "By entering the list of the Great Powers, we can attain even more attention for our country. Which in turn, will make our Resort even more popular!

As our Jewelry production only goes up lately, they will be pretty helpful for us."

 HVR_ties_with_moon_title: "Our Ties with Moon"
 HVR_ties_with_moon_desc: "Iku, being the messenger of Dragon Palace, regularly visits Lunar Capital. Even Tenshi has been here a few times. Our relations with Lunar Capital can be described as mutual neutrality. As Celestials are considered to be pure beings, Lunarians do not view us as enemies, but rather, as something close to distant acquaintance.\n\nBut recently, as Lunarians face a crisis in the face of Junko invasion, we can improve our relations, taking them to another level. We can help them deal with Junko, but in return, they will be forced to become our Junior partners. They might disagree with that offer, but we can always try. The other solution would be to just overtake them by force, while they are preoccupied with Junko."

As Lunarians has been taken over by us, as a Junior partner, they at least expect us to rule with just. Right now, their sole desire is to completely repel invaders from the Moon, and regain complete control over it, and we shall help them with that.
