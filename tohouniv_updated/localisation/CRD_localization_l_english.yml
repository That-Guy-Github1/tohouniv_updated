 SCR_politics_in_gensokyo_desc: "The situation in Gensokyo has become precarious. Usually conflicts get solved with a fancy danmaku battle and with tea in the afternoon, but lately more and more faces popped up in Gensokyo and declared to follow their ambitions - and be it even with force. While our realm has competent fighters, it is no challenge against an alliance of our rivals. We need to use our charismatic aura and find allies before things get from bad to worse!"
 SCR_politics_in_gensokyo_tt: "Allied countries, who are the §YRivals§! of §Y[Root.GetName]'s§! enemies or rivals."
 SCR_unite_the_mansions_title:0 "Unite the Mansions"
 SCR_unite_the_mansions_desc:0 "If it comes to prestigous houses of Gensokyo, there are only two: the Scarlets and the Komeijis. Of course there some others, but nobody should really care about a princess stuck with rabbits or a prince trying to return to relevance. However, the Komeiji's are a major power of Gensokyo and control the parts, which used to be Former Hell. It would be better if Chireiden is under our control of a Scarlet - and as a bonus: Flandre will be happy to play with her friend Koishi."
 SCR_appeal_to_satori_title: "Appease Satori"
 SCR_appeal_to_satori_desc: "Satori is a pride person and even if all of Chireiden is technically under our control, it is still the Komeijis, who are in charge of Former Hell. If we really want to gain Satori fullest support, we have to appease the pride mind reader, her little sister and all of Satori's subjects - and changing the fate of Satori into obedience does not work..."

 SCR_scarlet_navy_title: "Form the Scarlet Navy"

 SCR_expand_the_coastline_desc: "The Misty Lake is home to many more than just our people. While the important persons live in the Scarlet Devil Mansion on the island, the coastline of the lake has been inhabited my youkais and - much, much worse - fairies. It would be wise to tidy up the Misty Lake coastline and start with the conquest of the nuisances, which are known as the fairies. Oh, and we could take the noisy neighbors out too while we are at it."
 SCR_nebulosus_lacus_nostrum_title: "Nebulosu Lacus Nostrum"
 SCR_nebulosus_lacus_nostrum_desc: "The Misty Ambitions are almost finished! Only the Youkai Forest remains with a coast at the Misty Lake, but they should be no challenge for our forces.

 SCR_elegance_of_the_sdm_title: "An elegant Realm"
 SCR_elegance_of_the_sdm_desc: "A powerful military is one thing, but our [Root.GovernmentName] is an aspect, which reflects our noble origin way better than anything else: Elegance and Prestige! It starts with the head maid Sakuya Izayoi and only continues with the whole society of [Root.GetName] to the very top; to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. We should make sure that our whole Realm reflects this important pillar of our culture!"
 SCR_integrate_cirno_title: "Icy Nuisance"
 SCR_integrate_cirno_desc: "Originally, our home was once the island of the fairies led by Cirno. When Remilia set her foot in Gensokyo, she saw the potential of the island and the lands claimed by the fairy. She quickly transported the mansion to the island and hired a majority of the more mature and smarter fairies as our maidens. However, the ice brain Cirno saw this business as an invasion and tried to use violence to get us of the island. Cirno didn't get far though as she was immediately knocked out by Sakuya.\nEver since, Cirno has become our vassal. But her performance is ... questionable at best. It would be the best if we take direct control over her land."
 SCR_shikigami_maidens_title: "Shikigami Maidens"
 SCR_shikigami_maidens_desc: "The fairy maidens might be cute to look at, but they have proven to be more than useless if it comes to any task given to them. While Sakuya can and does handle the household all on her own, it is not an effective way of using her strengths in the grand picture. Luckily, Remilia's personal rival Yukari has summoned creatures, which are known as \"shikigami\" - very useful and obedient servants. If we take over Mayohiga, we can claim some of her shikigamis for own and save Sakuya a lot of headaches."
 SCR_sakuya_the_incident_solver_title: "Maiden's Duties"
 SCR_sakuya_the_incident_solver_desc: "While our household is now managed by maidens, who outclass the fairies in every way, Sakuya has now less stress to deal with. However, fate is not always grateful to us and as such we are confronted with the Incidents and Danmaku Fights of Gensokyo. Of course our mistress is not too interested to be involved in both businesses, so for many of these issues the maiden Sakuya has to jump in and has to fight in Remilia's name."
 SCR_gate_keeper_corps_title: "Meiling Guards"
 SCR_gate_keeper_corps_desc: "Meiling Hong is the head of the security of the mansion and the strongest gate keeper. Although she is by far the most powerful of the gate keepers, she is not the only one of [Root.GetName]. However, the other gate keepers are currently in \"self declared, unlimited vacations\", so we need to hire some replacement.\nMeiling suggested some of her personal trained guards as new troops. We should consider this option..."
 SCR_gate_keeper_corps_ct: "§Y[5071.GetName]§! will be heavily fortified and will get following modifiers:\nFort Level: §G+1§!\nLocal Defensiveness: §G+35.0%§!\nAdditionally, the fort will always pay for itself. The modifier is only active if the province has an up-to-date fort."
 SCR_meiling_vs_sakuya_title: "Gate Keeper Training"
 SCR_meiling_vs_sakuya_desc: "Although Meiling is a very reliable and loyal gate keeper, she gets often accused for slacking off. [Root.Monarch.GetName] of course doesn't believe these acusations and Meiling proofs it daily with her training. We should consider giving our troops a similar training too."
 SCR_expand_the_army_title: "The Grand Army"
 SCR_expand_the_army_desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has great ambitions - way too great with the army size we have right now to fulfil them. In a world, where danmaku duels are no longer enough to get your will through, we need to expand our army and prepare our people for the battles beforehead."
 SCR_meilings_ambitions_title: "Face the Dragon"
 SCR_meilings_ambitions_desc: "Meiling always likes to talk about her homeland, the mighty realm of the China, the Empire of the Middle. She says no realm in Gensokyo could beat 3500 years of history. While our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] respects such love for the homeland, it still sounds like a challenge we should take. If we can even beat the mighty dragon than there's nobody who could endanger our new Empire!"
 SCR_the_investigator_issue_title: "Challenge Reimu"
 SCR_the_investigator_issue_desc: "Gensokyo is a wild land and many of their residents try to do their own shenanigans, which later often get labelled as \"Incidents\". Of course Remilia's prank of releasing the Scarlet Mist has been treated as one of these Incident. Fortunately for Gensokyo (and a little bit unfortunate for Remilia), there is a Shrine Maiden called Reimu Hakure, who makes sure that these Incidents get resolved.\nAlthough our mistress has no grudges against Reimu, the residents of the Mansion feel that there has to be done about these Investigators..."
 SCR_humiliate_green_reimu_title: "Dominate Sanae"
 SCR_humiliate_green_reimu_desc: "Defeating Reimu is an impressive feat of our realm, but there is still another shrine maiden in Gensokyo, who would like to make our life harder. A new and enthuasiastic priestess called \"Sanae Kochiya\" has been rising in power and influence. We should show her who truly is in charege of Gensokyo!"
 SCR_humiliate_green_reimu_tt: "The conditions of this mission get revealed after §YChallenge Reimu§! is completed."

 SCR_power_of_favors_title: "Trustful Alliance"
 SCR_power_of_favors_desc: "While overwhelming power is nice and all, we need allies who can admire our strength. But not any ordinary allies - they need to be enchanted by the glorious charisma of our mistress herself and have a deep trust in us!"
 ###SCR EVENTS###
 flavor_scr.6.t: "[Root.GetName] and the Former Hell"
 flavor_scr.6.desc.a: "With our military superiority and the finesse of [Root.Monarch.GetName], we managed to take control over the throne of [CRD.GetName], the rulers of Former Hell. However, despite our clear superiority, Satori and Koishi Komeiji don't recognize the might of our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. And as such all of our demands for support only meet on deaf ears. While Remilia could manipulate fate and force them to serve, it would just cause a long term problem with the residents of Former Hell.\nNo, to gain the support of the [CRD.GetAdjective] they need a proof that we treat the Komeijis with the highest respect and try our best to appease them."
 flavor_scr.6.desc.b: "With the fall of [CRD.GetName], the invasion into Former Hell was an easy task. However, the residents of that region have proven to be quite resistent towards [Root.GetAdjective] authority. While the Komeijis might be technically their leaders anymore, the inhabitants of Former Hell still hear the word of hers more than ours. If we want to get control over the situation we need to convince them of ourselves. This also means we need to appease the two great satoris, who are still lurking in the Former Hell's shadows."
 flavor_scr.6.a: "Appease the mind reader? How should I even begin..."
 flavor_scr.6.a.tt: "All provinces in the §YFormer Hell Region§!, which are owned by us or by our subject, which is not [CRD.GetName], get '§YNot my Mistress§!' until the §YKomeijis have been appeased§!, giving the followinig effects:\nLocal Unrest: §R+1.00§!\nMinimum Local Autonomy: §R+95.00§!"
 flavor_scr.6.a.ct: "[CRD.GetName] will refuse to aid [Root.Monarch.GetName] in any wars and will not pay any tribute. This will go until [CRD.Monarch.GetName] and [CRD.Monarch.GetHerHis] family and subjects have been §Yappeased§!."
 flavor_scr.9.t: "Former Hell recognizes [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 flavor_scr.9.desc.a: "Satori Komeiji is not a person, who trusts many people - especially when said people have conquered her home not too long ago and forced Chireiden into a Dominion. However, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven her, that our realm has best of intentions for the people of Former Hell and for her family. At first the mind reader didn't want to believe it, but our efforts to increase the security of Chireiden, to support Koishi in her quest and to help the residents of Former Hell have left a good impression of us.\nAfter several hours of talk, the Komeijis have declared ready to step down of the throne of Former Hell and allow [Root.Monarch.GetName] to get in charge!"
 flavor_scr.9.desc.b: "The residents of Former Hell are distrustful creatures and our conquest of their home didn't increase their opinion of us at all. However, after a long campaign of improving the lives of the people and even the Komeiji sisters, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been received in Chireiden with a new found level of respect!"
 flavor_scr.9.a: "I promise I will ruler over Former Hell as good as I can!"
 flavor_scr.9.a.tt: "Provinces in §YFormer Hell§! owned by us or by any subject will no longer be affected by the modifier '§YNot my Mistress§!'."
 flavor_scr.9.a.ct: "[CRD.GetName] will now be obedient towards [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_scr.10.t: "The Vampire and the Mind Reader"
 flavor_scr.10.desc: "Months have passed since Satori stepped down as the ruler of Former Hell. Since then, she has started to take more care of herself and Koishi and even started to meet with Remilia to discuss further plans for Hell. While she might be no longer the ruler, she still cares for her pets and her subjects. One day, Satori and Remilia decided to dine together. While talking about the development of Chireiden's borders, Remilia's thoughts wandered around..."
 flavor_scr.10.a: "*Think of how cute she is*"
 flavor_scr.10.b: "*Think of what's tomorrow's dinner*"
 flavor_scr.11.t: "The little Sisters of Two Dynasties"
 flavor_scr.11.desc: "Unlike Remilia and Satori, the relationship between Flandre and Koishi has always been on friendly terms - even if it is a very unknown friendship. After all, only a handful people can even recognize Koishi so it is no surprise that she always managed to bypass the guard of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and visit her good friend Flandre.\nBefore the conquest of Chireiden, Flandre had plenty of time to spend with Koishi, but now she is in a position, where so much weight is on her shoulders and as such the time to play with Koishi has been significantly rarer, which saddens Koishi. However, one day, Koishi stormed into the throne room and had the briliant idea of how to get more play time together! And so, Koishi proposed to Flandre in public, but only the two of them know what's going on while everyone else notice nothing ..."
 flavor_scr.11.a: "*Take Koishi's proposal*"
 flavor_scr.11.b: "I'm sorry, but you're more like a little sister to me..."
 flavor_scr.12.t: "Satori's Approval"
 flavor_scr.12.desc: "Satori never has been a person, who leaves Chireiden and takes great concern for her family - which is made up of just her little sister Koishi. However, to Satori's pain, Koishi is a free spirit and leaves Chireiden whenever she wants and can be then gone for several weeks, which worries Satori a lot.\nThanks to our effort of building a secure castle in Chireiden though, Koishi has found a new favourite location to stay, which is the very same fort. Her weeks of disappearance have changed to just a few days and thanks to the fort - and Satori is a whole lot happier now too!"
 flavor_scr.12.a: "You're welcome, Satori!"
 flavor_scr.12.a.tt: "Satori has been §Yappeased§!."
 flavor_scr.13.t: "The Mask of Hope for Koishi"
 flavor_scr.13.desc: "Through a chain of events and fate, our troops happened to raid the infamous Masks Gallery, the home of Kokoro Hata. All they could find were - well - masks. But one of them seemed to have magical properties. It was the Mask of Hope - an item, which was requested by Koishi. Flandre gave this mask to her and ever since then, Koishi is having the best mood ever."
 flavor_scr.13.a: "Here you go Koishi. Have some fun with the mask!"
 flavor_scr.13.a.tt: "Koishi has been §Yappeased§!."
 flavor_scr.14.t: "Former Hell Development"
 flavor_scr.14.desc: "With our declaration of a Dominion over Former Hell, many residents of Former Hell remained wary and distrustful towards [Root.Monarch.GetName]. But thanks to the efforts of our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the infrastructure of Former Hell has improved a lot and the many youkais of Chireiden started to accept [Root.Monarch.GetName] as their new overlord."
 flavor_scr.14.a: "See guys! I told you I bring improvement for you!"
 flavor_scr.14.a.tt: "The residents of Former Hell have been §Yappeased§!."
 flavor_scr.15.t: "Grand Oni Festieval"
 flavor_scr.15.desc: "Unlike all the other residents of Former Hell, the oni are not natives of this place. They are originally from the Youkai Mountain, which got occupied by the tengu later on. In a great war for suppority, the oni got defeated and were expelled from their former home.\nFortunately enough for them, [Root.Monarch.GetName] took matters in the hands and conquered this important place back for the oni. Now Yuugi and her kind are supporting our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and are throwing a big festival in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] honor!"
 flavor_scr.15.a: "Oni support never hurts to have!"
