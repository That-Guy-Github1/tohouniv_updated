But thanks to the efforts of our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], the infrastructure of Former Hell has improved a lot and the many youkais of Chireiden started to accept [Root.Monarch.GetName] as their new overlord."

 flavor_scr.15.desc: "Unlike all the other residents of Former Hell, the oni are not natives of this place. They are originally from the Youkai Mountain, which got occupied by the tengu later on. In a great war for suppority, the oni got defeated and were expelled from their former home.\nFortunately enough for them, [Root.Monarch.GetName] took matters in the hands and conquered this important place back for the oni. Now Yuugi and her kind are supporting our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and are throwing a big festival in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] honor!"

 flavor_scr.17.desc: "Maps of the outworld are a high rarity in Gensokyo - especially those, which go way beyond the ancient Japanese maps. Fortunately for us, Meiling still has her old maps from her time when she still lived in the Celestial Empire. She has been so nice to borrow her maps to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. However, she has requested to visit her home land again should we decide to travel to Chinese land..."

 flavor_scr.18.t: "Patchouli joins the Court"
 flavor_scr.18.desc: "Patchouli is a very ... relaxed person. She avoids sport, stays away from sunlight much more than any vampire would and has her nose only in books. It was quite the surprise for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to see her in the court room out of the sudden of course as Patchouli usually avoided politics too. But because of our mistress' help in her many experiments (and maybe because of one comment too many about her body weight), she decided to join [Root.Monarch.GetName] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] political business and support our realm with her advises."
 flavor_scr.18.a: "Always glad to see a competent advisor, Patchy!"
 flavor_scr.19.t: "Permanent Meiling's Guards?"
 flavor_scr.19.desc: "Meiling is a professional and as such she has standards. Way above of the standards of these filthy mercenaries, Meiling's Guards are the epitome of melee fighters. However, they are quite intense in their training and our realm will not be able to maintain both a free access to Meiling's units and to inferior but plenty mercenaries at the same time.\nHow shall [Root.Monarch.GetName]?"

 flavor_scr.20.desc: "It was a long session of alchemy, potion makings and browsing through the several tomes, but after several hours Patchouli finished the flask for the experiment with Koakuma! A black liquid with caramel-colored foam at top of it, bottled up in a glas flask. After receiving this potion, Koakuma jumped up full with energy and enthusiasm for any task given - the experiment was a success!\nOn a side note: Koakuma praises the taste of this \"soft drink\" and suggested to name it \"Koa-Kuma\"."
 flavor_scr.20.a: "Koakuma, your strength is exploring the new world. Not naming some drinks."
 flavor_scr.21.t: "Moon Landing"
 flavor_scr.21.desc: "The rocket the kappas have created is a technological marvel. With 111 meters in height and over 2,938 tons, this behemoth of a missile has pierced the sky and reached the moon within under a week. Of course for Remilia this is really slow, but for the several hundreds of our vampiric colonists, this was a quick time.\nWhen the rocket landed on the moon, it immediately got a visit from curious moon rabbits. At first they appeared to be friendly, but when a weird noise appeared, the rabbits immediately opened fire. Fortunately our colonists are expert fighters and slaughtered these treacherous rabbits and enacted a counter attack, which disabled the lunar defenses.\nWe came to the moon as visitors, but got treated as invaders. There weren't many reasons for us to conquer the moon, but their hostility showed us that they are a threat to our realm and all life of Earth!"

 flavor_scr.22.t: "Power over the Moon"
 flavor_scr.22.desc: "The fight for the supremacy over the moon has been a bloody one, but in the end none of the lunarians withstood our onslaught. Now we have the power of moon itself and as such the vampiric strength of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been greatly increased - as well as the ones of our troops!"
 flavor_scr.22.a: "The moon is so red tonight..."
 flavor_scr.24.t: "The Scarlet Monarchy"
 flavor_scr.24.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has seen many battles. Be it in the frontline or in the briefing rooms - [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows of the struggle of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] warriors... and their bloodlust. Unlike our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], our soldiers are reveling in the heat of the battle and enjoy the combat even if they fall on the battlefield. While [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not share their enthusiasm, their blood lust, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors have made a plan to restructure the government to support their morale with the charisma of our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nThey also point out that with the establishment of a 'Scarlet Monarchy', our neighbors will have a better idea who they are dealing with and would even be ready to trust us."
 flavor_scr.24.a: "So a government with military and diplomatic focus? Sounds good."
 flavor_scr.25.t: "Island Browsing"
 flavor_scr.25.desc: "Finding a good starting base in Europe is not easy. Many Europeans refuse to see one of their main land provinces. Instead, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to rely on purchasing an island. Luckily, these humans are more than happy to sell some island to us - if the price is correct."

 flavor_scr.25.tt: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will make an offer of §R2000§! Ducats to the owner of this island.\nIf we do not view as enemies and the opinion is not below 0, the owner will most likely accept the offer."

 flavor_scr.26.desc: "A young girl in a formal attire arrived at our court and offered [Root.Monarch.GetName] 2000 Ducats in exchange for an island in our possession. She claims she is here in the name of her mistress, a batgirl, who is referred as the \"Scarlet Devil\"..."
 flavor_scr.26.a: "Devil or not, Ducats are always welcomed!"
 flavor_scr.26.b: "We do not make deals with the devil!"

 flavor_scr.28.a: "That's their loss then."
 flavor_scr.29.t: "Remilia's Ambitions"
 flavor_scr.29.desc: "With the return to Europe, our good mistress Remilia announced a long list of ambitions and claims her bloodline has created over centuries. It was a 30 meter long parchment, with various descriptions of claims: it starts with the title of Flanders ownership and ends with the right of forming a crusade in Anatolia!"
 flavor_scr.29.a: "And a lot more ambitions are on their way!"
 flavor_scr.30.t: "The missing Mansion"
 flavor_scr.30.desc: "After hours of travel, Remilia and Sakuya, arrived at the spot, where the origin of Sakuya is supposed to be, deep in the dark woods of Lancashire. But there was nothing. Just trees and wild life. Remilia looks confused at the sight. Sakuya notes to have a strange feeling of oddity ... as if they are too soon at this place. The maiden explains that the mansion; her place of origin might appear in a later century."
 flavor_scr.30.a: "Hmpf... whatever you say, Sakuya."
 flavor_scr.30.a.tt: "Remilia and Sakuya will return to this place after Queen Anne style architecture has been discovered in England."
 flavor_scr.31.t: "The Mansion of Liverpool"
 flavor_scr.31.desc: "Remila and Sakuya travelled to the little English town called \"Liverpool\". In order to avoid public attention, Remilia hid her wings in her attire.\nUpon their arrival, they got greeted by a polite butler. He seemed to recognize Sakuya... but at the same time he couldn't tell why.\nThe two girls entered the mansion and met with a noble merchant, who at first was worried because of the invited guests, but soon started to get along quite well with Remilia. It appears the man is one of the many aspiring aristocrats of the British Islands and has yet to learn a lot about being a gentleman. He too had an odd feeling of familiarity upon seeing Sakuya face, but just like the butler, he couldn't tell why.\nAfter a lengthy afternoon of chatting and enjoying tea, the vampire and her maiden came to no conclusion whatsoever and left the nobleman with a hearty farewell. In the carriage, Sakuya noted that they were too early. But she was happy to see the ancestors of her better half of her family..."
 flavor_scr.31.a: "At this point, I won't even ask. You're weird, Sakuya..."
 flavor_scr.33.t: "End of the Papacy"
 flavor_scr.33.desc: "A long time ago, humans lived in harmony with western 'youkai', fairies and other supernatural creatures. This all changed when Christianity spread through Europe though and quicky after that, every supernatural being - be it rightfully or not - has been hunted down to extinction. All in the name of the Christian beliefs and the Pope! But now the tables have turned and the Pope is at our mercy! As we all know, mercy is the mark of a great woman."
 flavor_scr.33.a: "Guess, I'm just a good woman. *Stabs* Well, I'm alright."
 flavor_scr.34.t: "Friendship Between Flandre and Koishi"
 flavor_scr.34.desc: "Most of the time the former rulers Satori and Remilia tolerated each other's presence, but neither of them tried for a better relation between their realms - unlike their little sisters. Flandre and Koishi were always good friends, and now, after their sisters left their thrones, their realms became great allies too."
 flavor_scr.34.a: "Let's hope for a never ending friendship."

 HKR_discover_europe_title: "Discover Europe"
 HKR_discover_europe_desc: "A lot of time has passed since the Breaking of the Hakurei Barrier and a lot of foreigners have come to Gensokyo. Fortunately they are usually peaceful traders and no threat to our homeland at all. But their stories of a rich continent, where dozens of clashing religions and diverse cultures made a lot of our people curious. We should explore the far west and see if their stories are true."
 HKR_scarlet_mist_incident_title: "Scarlet Mist Incident"
 HKR_scarlet_mist_incident_desc: "The first major incident, the Scarlet Mist Incident, was created by Remilia with her red fog, which blocks all sunlight. Although it was only temporary, it still caused chaos and unrest for the people, but thanks to a shrine maiden the incident was quickly solved."

 HKR_eternal_night_incident_title: "Eternal Night Incident"
 HKR_eternal_night_incident_desc: "An usual night. Or at least an usual night in the eyes of a human. But for the youkai it is incredible nerve-wrenching night as the Moon, which usually shines over the Gensokyo is replaced with nothing but an imitation. This was the rumored Eternal Night Incident, caused by Lunarian princess, who tried to hide from her people from the moon. To the youkai's appeal the fake Moon didn't persist for long as the princess got defeated."

 HKR_control_over_the_tree_title: "Control over Saigyou Ayakashi"
 HKR_control_over_the_tree_desc: "In the Netherwold lives a demonic cherry blossom tree, which attracts many people to their death. While it is sealed by the ghost princess Yuyuko herself it is still a great danger for everyone - and the fact that Yuyuko also has to rule over a realm doesn't help the seal. We should take control over this dangerous tree and reinforce the seals with Hakurei spells."
 HKR_convert_the_human_capital_title: "Convert the Human Capital"
 HKR_convert_the_human_capital_desc: "The humans in the Human Capital, the heart of Gensokyo, are kindhearted, but they follow a heretic religion from old times. These Buddhistic minds stray them from the Gensokyan gods and corrupt even more people. We should stop this heresy immediately."
 HKR_stop_the_taoistic_heresy_title: "Stop the Taoistic Heresy"
 HKR_stop_the_taoistic_heresy_desc: "In Gensokyo there's not only the Buddhistic heresy. In recent times a stranger from the ancient land Japan arrived in Gensokyo and converted the local population - only through her charismatic speakings - to the strange religion of Taoism. This 'prince' is a threat for the way of the gods and should be reminded that we are the religious head of Gensokyo."
 HKR_convert_gensokyo_title: "Convert Gensokyo"
 HKR_convert_gensokyo_desc: "The biggest religious threats are now gone. The only task left is to clean the left heresy in the rest of Gensokyo up. After that we can truely call our realm a religious empire."

 HKR_challenge_the_moriya_shrine_desc: "Behind the Youkai Mountain a new shrine emerged and tries to compete for the favor of the gods with our realm. We shall challenge these amateurs and show them how a real shrine realm looks like."
 HKR_subjugate_sanae_title: "Subjugate Sanae's Realm"
 HKR_subjugate_sanae_desc: "Sanae, the shrine maiden of the Moriya Shrine, is a lovely person and a worthy rival. Her realm, however, is still a reason for the people of Gensokyo to question our religious authority. We should end this immediately and integrate Sanae's realm and skills in our theocracy."
 HKR_create_an_empire_title: "Create the Hakurei Empire"
 HKR_create_an_empire_desc: "Gensokyo was for the most part relatively peaceful. But the recent Breaking of the Barrier and the growth of heresy made Gensokyo a place of fighting and wars. If we want to bring peace back we have to create a powerful empire, which can represent an authority for Gensokyo and protect its people from religious and military threats."
 HKR_convert_japan_title: "Convert Japan"
 HKR_convert_japan_desc: "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbour Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours. Much time has passed since then and the Japanese Shintoism and the Gensokyan Shintoism are now two completely different religions. Yet, if we show them the 'new' form of Shintoism, our Shintoism, they could save themself from their heresy."
 HKR_enlighten_korea_title: "Convert Korea"
 HKR_enlighten_korea_desc: "With the conversion of the heart of Japan our religious influence in Asia grew immensely. But we are not done yet! The Koreans follow the old way of Confucian, which has many old and useful traditions and mindsets, but it is also outdated. We need to help them so they can follow the way to fortune too!"
 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_title: "Challenge the Dragon"
 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_desc: "Confucian is an interesting religion: it promotes humanistic ideas and tolerance and it is filled with ancient traditions. But it can also become a danger for any realm, because of these ideas and tradition the state gets slowed down and can't make fast decisions. This problem is currently the cause of the Celestial Empire's fighting. They are slowed in their actions, yet they are still holding on their outdated mindsets. We should challenge them and save them from themselves!"
 HKR_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_title: "Unification Under One Religion"
 HKR_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_desc: "In the history of Asia, China, Korea and Japan have never had a good relation with each other and wars between these were more common than it should be. But with the unification of these countries under one, wholesome religion the conflicts may finally stop."
 HKR_expel_the_foreigners_title: "Protect Gensokyo"

 HKR_expand_the_hakurei_barrier_desc: "The old Hakurei Barrier made of magic is lost forever. But this doesn't mean we have failed at our duty as protectors of Gensokyo. Instead we will make a new, naval barrier around Gensokyo and the isles of Micronesia and Taiwan will allow us to build a decent defense line."
 HKR_monopolize_trade_to_gensokyo_title: "Monopolize The Trade Flows to Gensokyo"
 HKR_monopolize_trade_to_gensokyo_desc: "The Breaking of the old Barrier isn't that bad: it allows now for interesting and profitable trading with the outer world. Yet, the foreign nations are still not trustworthy. If we monopolize every trade node which flows into Gensokyo we can better prepare for their possible plans of conquest. Ohh... and the profit we will make is nice too. Very nice."

 HKR_gensokyos_investigator_desc: "Gensokyo was a relatively peaceful land. But these times are over and now youkai, humans, gods and what not are planning to gain more power or to push their agendas in Gensokyo. It is to Reimu to solve these incidents - and earn some additional money this way."

 HKR_incident_variable_is_init: "The Incident Counter is ready."
 HKR_witch_trial_title: "Witch Trial"
 HKR_witch_trial_desc: "While their friendship is unquestionable, Marisa and Reimu still have their own realms to manage. Additionally, Marisa is eager to show Gensokyo her superiority in power over Reimu and while this is a commendable ambition, it is troublesome when we need the Forest's help. Reimu needs to show her that her skills are still unmatched!"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_title: "Restore Hakurei Prestige"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_desc: "With the break of the Hakurei Barrier as well as appearances of heretic religions, the Hakurei shrine maiden's authority has been questioned. Many people see Reimu as a lazy girl, who doesn't care for humanity's safety. Additionally, religious new-comer like Sanae, Byakuren and Miko are earning all the donations, which should be in Hakurei possession. To end this vicious cycle, we must show our capability and reliability-- at least on the surface at the first step."
 HKR_religious_rivals_title: "Religious Rivalry"
 HKR_religious_rivals_desc: "On the other side of the Youkai Mountain lives Sanae Kochiya, a outlandish and powerful colleague of Reimu. However, Sanae is a heretic and while their relationship isn't that bad, Sanae causes the lack of donors as her shrine gets all the people! She also showed great ambition to spread her religion to all of Gensokyo and challenged our status! We can't indulge in her any longer!"
 HKR_defeat_the_rival_title: "End the Rivalry"
 HKR_defeat_the_rival_desc: "It is time to finally end the rivalry between Moriya and Hakurei! If we ever want to get our authority back in Gensokyo we have to take over the Moriya lands and convert it to the true Shinto ways!"
 HKR_influence_human_capital_title: "Influence the Capital"
 HKR_influence_human_capital_desc: "Human capital is the biggest city with the largest human population, and the biggest trade center in Gensokyo. Who can control it controls the heart of Gensokyo. Although people there mostly follow our faith, they seldom go to our shrine and donate to us. We must show them the necessity of going to the shrine and open a direct smooth passage from human capital to our shrine."
 HKR_influence_human_capital_tt: "The reward is depending on how our relationship is with the owner of Human Capital. If we go the diplomatic way our reward will be more appealing for diplomacy while conquest / subjugation rewards us with military power.\n\nEvery non-[Root.Religion.GetName] province in §YHuman Capital§! or §YFarmlands§! owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country will be converted to §Y[Root.Religion.GetName]§!."
 HKR_regulate_myouren_temple_title: "Regulate Myouren Temple"
 HKR_regulate_myouren_temple_desc: "A group of Buddhists, led by Byakuren Hijiri, has landed in the near countryside of the Human Capital. Although they didn't show great desire to spread their faith, they still sought out after control of the capital. We should show them that they can't challenge the status of Hakurei Shinto as the main religion of Gensokyo."
 HKR_warn_the_celestial_title: "Eliminate Tenshi!"
 HKR_warn_the_celestial_desc: "Tenshi Hinanawi is leading the celestial realm with Taoism faith just like Miko did with Senkai. Although she is far from mainland Gensokyo, Tenshi has the tendency to cause a lot of serious troubles in Gensokyo - and she is quite willing to do so. We should make an example of her and reduce the threat she poses over Gensokyo!"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_title: "Back to the Past"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_desc: "Originally the Hakurei clan as well as Reimu Hakurei used to live in the northern part of Gensokyo. However, times have changed and the Clan moved to the more fertile and strategically important south so the resources were assured for a reformation of the Hakurei Shinto with the Danmaku system. But some people from the north didn't like this decision and remained \"Hakurei Traditional\" - lead by Meira, an old challenger of Reimu. Meira claimed to become the next, better Hakurei miko. We should teach her that a Hakurei miko's authority is not easily claimed!"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_tt: "Every province owned by [Root.GetName] or its subjects in §YEastern§! and §YWestern Old Hakurei Shrine§! will §Glose§! all separatism and autonomy and gain the §YCall to Arms for Reimu§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, which gives the following effects:\nLocal Manpower: §G25%§!\n"
 HKR_devil_from_the_past_title: "Devil from the Past"
 HKR_devil_from_the_past_desc: "We are back to the old Hakurei Shrine, a relic of old times. But now that we've returned we have to face the old neighbors too: Shinki, the powerful creator and goddess of Makai, has shown a great desire to increase her own status in Gensokyo. She tried to establish a new religion and to spread that to all Gensokyans. Although she is a goddess, we can't allow such actions. We have to shut her down and make sure no evil creature or mind will ever come out of Makai."
 HKR_devil_from_the_past_no_province: "No province outside of §YMakai Coast§!, §YWestern Makai§!, §YMakai§! and §YMakai Peninsula§! follows §YShinkism§!."

 HKR_train_a_miko_army_title: "Train the Miko Army"
 HKR_train_a_miko_army_desc: "While spellcards are still the norm of duels it won't protect a realm. Every country is building their very own army to compete for a higher status in Gensokyo. As the regulator of Gensokyo in name, we must build our own army now to make this name justified!"
 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_title: "Defeat the Scarlet Devil"
 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_desc: "Remilia Scarlet is a weird person - even for Gensokyan standards. While her nature as a vampire suggests only bad things for humans and our realm, her behaviour is in complete contrast to it as she rarely even interact with humans.\nStill, Remilia has the title of the \"Scarlet Devil\" and we heard that she plans on militarizing the fairies working for her. Because of these circumstances we should strike on her first."
 HKR_suppress_youkai_underground_title: "Suppress Former Hell"
 HKR_suppress_youkai_underground_desc: "The Former Hell, once a place where the evil souls atone for their sins, is now home of the banished, trouble seeking oni, the sinister satoris and other dangerous youkai. While the other residents are not threatening the balance of power in Gensokyo, the oni though might be different: rumors tell that they are gathering power to try to retake the Youkai Mountain - and eventually more from Gensokyo. And the satoris, who are supposed to control them, aren't much trustworthy either. We should take control over these threats ourselves and cleanse heretics on the way."
 hkr_mission_to_not_hakurei_tt: "Every province in §YFormer Hell§! that is owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country but not itself [Root.Religion.GetName] will gain the §YShrine Maidens on Mission§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, which gives the following effects:\nLocal Missionary Maintenance Cost: §G-25.0%§!\nLocal Missionary Strength: §G+3.0%§!\nLocal Unrest: §G-3§!\n"

 HKR_demons_of_higan_title: "The Animalistic Threat"
 HKR_demons_of_higan_desc: "Usually they have little to no business for the living in Hell, but shrine maidens reported beast spirits leaving Hell and taking the living in Gensokyo! Of course Reimu reacted quickly and eliminated these spirits as well as challenged those who unleashed them to the mortal world.\nHowever, the rulers - those who let these spirits free - still live on in the Animal Realm of Hell. If we want to make sure that there will never again be a threat from them we have to subjugate their rulers."

 HKR_gather_allies_title: "Gather Allies"
 HKR_gather_allies_desc: "The times have changed in Gensokyo and every inhabitant of this once so peaceful land knows it. Youkai gather fairies and train them to soldiers, humans start praying to Gods of Wars and heresies are about to be created.\nWhile our shrines have competent defenders, they are no match against an overwhelming force during times of wars. We must ensure the survival of our [Root.GovernmentName] by gathering devout allies."
 HKR_gather_allies_tt: "[Root.GetName] must be allied with §Y3 [Root.Religion.GetName]§! countries."
 HKR_great_power_title: "Gensokyo's Great Powers"
 HKR_great_power_desc: "It's obvious that some realms have more influence and power in Gensokyo than others. As our goal is to keep Gensokyo safe from outer and inner threats we must make sure that we belong to the great powers of Gensokyo or else any attempt to keep the religious unity and peace in Gensokyo will be doomed to fail."

 HKR_future_of_shinto_desc: "Hakurei Shintoism is an evolved denomination of the original Japanese Shintoism.

 HKR_the_gap_hag_threat_desc: "Reimu Hakurei and Yukari Yakumo have a strange relationship: while they both serve Gensokyo by maintaining the Hakurei Barrier, they both have a lot of arguments and teasing. However, unlike Reimu, Yukari has a lot of potential to cause a lot of chaos not only in Gensokyo but also outside and due to her complex mind it's not easy to understand her schemes.\nIt would be beneficial for everyone when she and Reimu reform the Barrier Team again."

 HKR_new_power_distribution_desc: "Suika Ibuki is a traveling Oni, who likes to drink and cause brawls. While she is not a resident of the Hakurei Shrine per se, she is still a very often seen person at the Hakurei Shrine. One day, the shrine maiden, the humans and Suika got in a conflict at the shrine, which ended in a hefty brawl and Suika leaving [Root.GetName].\nWhile she is already gone, it got revealed later that the youkai of our realm planned this conflict to get more influence within the [Root.GovernmentName].

 HKR_genji_the_turtle_desc: "Despite his age and his ... turtle being ... Genjii is a powerful defender of the Shrine and served Reimu as a flying device before she learned to fly on her own. Because of that service, Genjii suffers heavy back pain and is currently basically useless. He needs some healing before he can help us out yet again.\nFortunately, the Aki Sisters in the Shrine of Harvest have some helpful ingredients for the healing.

 HKR_harness_shions_power_desc: "There are many gods in Gensokyo, but none is as costly to house as Shion Yorigami, the goddess of poverty. And because of her powers she causes a lot of bad luck to all the people around her... except for Tenshi. While Reimu often played with the idea of banishing her from the Shrine, Heavenly Realm will not take her either.\nLuckily Reimu had an idea: harnessing the power of Shion in the Shrine's favor. And to test the weaponized poverty out we should unleash her misfortune on one of our rivals."

Ironically though, Reimu thought that Aunn was an intruder and beat her up in a danmaku duel. Because of that misunderstanding she felt quite bad about it and promised to repay to Aunn with a cute gift. However, our realm does not have many possible gifts for such a sweet person like Aunn.

 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_desc: "For such an important country like ours it is important to be aware of our origins and the history we have made in Gensokyo.

 HKR_touhou_2_title: "March on Reimaden"
 HKR_touhou_2_desc: "While meditating about the past our good Shrine Maiden Reimu remembered that she left the ancient, powerful Yin-Yang Orbs in Reimaden, the home of the vengeful spirit Mima - and she will not give them back easily. It will take some political finesse as well as a big army to show her strength to get Mima returning the Yin-Yang Orbs back to Reimu.\nOr we could just march into Reimaden ourselves and take the orbs from Mima."

Usually Marisa could always 'borrow' some of these books but with the recent events everyone in Gensokyo became more tense and Marisa has lost her access to the library. Perhaps it is time to change our method: instead of borrowing the books we annex the library and with it the Scarlet Devil Mansion directly to our realm."
 FOM_rinnosukes_shop_title: "Rinnosuke's Shop"
 FOM_rinnosukes_shop_desc: "If there is good price, we are glad to pay money for books and materials too. In the north next to the Human Capital there's Kourindou, or better known as the shop of Rinnosuke Morichika. Rinnosuke is an expert in identifying the true value of treasures we loot and pays us a good amount of money, but the people of the Human Capital started to isolate themselves, which makes trading with Rinnosuke difficult.

According to Eirin's notes and the books from the Voile Library the Elixir can only be brewed on a place where the air is extremely thin. One of these places is the Youkai Mountain in Gensokyo. We should establish a laboratory there."

 FOM_results_of_magic_and_technology_desc: "The lab is finished, but the environment doesn't satisfy the requirements for the Elixir - even though it is the mountain with the thinnest air! Fortunately, there are people who could help us out: the Kappa in the west have advanced technology, which they use for incredible things like sucking air from the environment, but they're completely unorganized and until they find the machines we need we would've already died from age.\nAlternatively we can hijack the space vessel of Okazaki. Her technology is on par with those of the kappas, but she won't give it to us on her own. Either way, we need to take control over either realm and reorganize them for our purpose."

In her case the old goddess Shinki, master of Makai, was her teacher and, similar to Mima, Shinki used rather strict teaching methods. Now Shinki watches over her realm which contains dangerous miasma and raw magic.\nAlice grew up there under the care of Shinki. Years have passed since Alice left her old home of Makai, but she is still a legitimate Makaian and the closest relative to Shinki, which gives Alice a justified claim on the throne of Makai... and its plentiful doll workshops."

Shinki, the very goddess who created this world and taught Alice the art of creating dolls, still lurks in the depths of her palace. Alice needs to meet with her in order to learn the highly advanced doll control techniques Shinki has developed, but she is a very stubborn goddess.
