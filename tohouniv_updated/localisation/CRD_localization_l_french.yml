 CRD_SDM_nuisance_desc: "Showing the administrative superiority has convinced the other residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, Remilia remains stubborn.

 CRD_taste_for_power_title: "Taste of Power"
 CRD_taste_for_power_desc: "In the early days of Former Hell, the place was filled with demons and leftover spirits the yama did not want to deal with. Fortunately for them, the Komeiji family moved into this region and took over Former Hell through diplomacy and manipulation.\nHowever, this was just foretaste. Kingdoms conquer land through their own force, true empires use subjects to do the dirty work for them instead. We should expand our influence and upgrade our vassals to even more formidable brutes for our bidding."

 CRD_third_eye_title: "Third Eye"

 CRD_mind_reading_diplomacy_title: "Mind-Reading Diplomacy"
 CRD_mind_reading_diplomacy_desc: "The expansion through direct conquest will raise a lot of alert in neighboring countries. It may be more efficient to claiming that we are the guardians of small countries as entice and charm them into our sphere of influence. And [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ability will be a great help to this strategy."
 CRD_perfect_mind_manipulation_title: "Perfect Mind Manipulation"
 CRD_perfect_mind_manipulation_desc: "Reading the mind is one basic ability every satori possesses. But the potential is much, much larger. Our mistress Satori has seen it and knows that the third eye can reach abilities some would consider... unnatural - the power of mind control.\nHowever, to achieve this state our kind needs to practice and learn all the tricks and techniques and perfect their skills.\nIt is our utter highest priority to do that."

 CRD_training_army_title: "Army of the Underworld"
 CRD_training_army_desc: "Life in Former Hell is mostly as peaceful as it can get in Hell. Sadly this is not a constant though.

 CRD_two_heavens_under_one_sky_title: "Two Heavens under One Sky"
 CRD_two_heavens_under_one_sky_desc: "Our realm has grown to a respectable power in Gensokyo and we even have the might of Hell and Heaven on our side. Yet we can't say we're the true masters of Hell and Heaven as long the Celestial Empire has its Mandate of Heaven. If Gensokyo were in isolation as before, their claim about mandate of heaven would have nothing to do with us. but the world has changed and there cannot be two empires that govern in the name of heaven. We must drive out this pretender and let them know that we are the only master of the heaven."

 CRD_entrance_to_the_mandate_of_heaven_desc: "Celestial Empire is mighty and formidable country even for us. We need to be thoroughly prepared to beat them. Korea is located in center of the order led by the Celestial Empire, and their geographical location has excellent conditions to enter the Celestial Empire. Putting them into our sphere would be a good means of destroying the authority of the Celestial Empire and placing our troops right in front of them."
 CRD_take_the_mandate_of_heaven_title: "Take the Mandate of Heaven"
 CRD_take_the_mandate_of_heaven_desc: "All preparations are made and our empire is ready to bring the mighty dragon to its knees! The claim of the Mandate of Heaven shall be ours or it will perish before the might of the master of the blazing hell!"
 CRD_scarlet_demand_title: "Convince Remilia"
 CRD_scarlet_demand_desc: "While the conquest of the Scarlet Devil Mansion was a breeze, the childish vampire Remilia refuses to acknowledge Satori as her only ruler. Of course Satori could hypnotize Remilia and force obedience, but this would be only a temporary solution - and the reputation of our kind is already suffering more than enough.\nNo. The only way to get Remilia's respect is by showing her the vastly superiority which the satori are at householding a realm."
 CRD_quest_of_religion_title: "Show Religious Color"
 CRD_quest_of_religion_desc: "[Root.GetName] has never been a very religous realm. The spirits and demons of Former Hell usually enjoy their Hakurei beliefs in peace. However, this changed when a radical shrine maiden has introduced a new way of Shintoism in Gensokyo. Many of our people have been converted over time and due to the nature of this ... Moriya Shintoism... they want to spread their faith. Whether driving this faith out or accepting it, we need a quick decision from [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 CRD_gensokyan_politics_title: "Gensokyan Politics"
 CRD_gensokyan_politics_desc: "Our realm has a history of isolationism and for the most part it works quite fine. There were not many reasons to interact with others and the lowborn people of Gensokyo looked at us in fear and spite anyway due to our mind reading ability.\nHowever, the stench of war is clouding the air. In times like these, even a \"frowned upon\" realm like [Root.GetName] makes a valuable ally. We should exploit these circumstances and build our own net of alliances."
 CRD_fortify_chireiden_title: "Fortify [Root.GetName]"
 CRD_fortify_chireiden_desc: "Our home region might be underground, but it is horrendous to defend. Everything is just flat land and no natural defense blocks possible invaders. We should construct forts at key positions to avoid our downfall."

 CRD_expand_infrastructure_title: "Hellish Infrastructure"

 CRD_stabilize_former_hell_title: "Dismantle the Estates"
 CRD_stabilize_former_hell_desc: "Now that the oni are fully on our side, it is time to get rid of the power of the scheming estates. The rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is absolute and we must ensure that it stays that way!"

 CRD_hegemony_of_gensokyo_desc: "Now we have succeeded in establishing the authority of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] external and internal. What remains is to suppress other forces of Gensokyo, and declare that only [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the true ruler. Would not one can challenge [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] authority!"

 CRD_seize_the_newspaper_title: "Seize the Newspaper"
 CRD_seize_the_newspaper_desc: "The reputation of our kind has never been in a good spot, but these pesky tengus in their mountains are making thins much worse. Every day, they write new papers explaning their justification of owning the Youkai Mountain and printing a bad image of Former Hell - and much worse - of satori kind!\nWe should move these birdbrains from the printers as far away as possible."
 CRD_conquer_the_hell_region_title: "Unite the Hells"
 CRD_conquer_the_hell_region_desc: "The yama had their time - and they did not clean the mess what is their new hell. It is up to us to end these beast gang wars and unite Hell and Former Hell to one, centralized region."

We should get to the Masks Gallery and obtain this mask for the young mistress Koishi."
 CRD_paradise_of_spirit_title: "Exploit Hell's Resource"
 CRD_paradise_of_spirit_desc: "While the improvement of infrastructure was more than welcome, many of our people started demanding goods and luxuries we cannot afford to import. Fortunately, Former Hell is a region with rich resources. We should expand the infrastructure even further and construct several manufactories in order to develop our realm into an economic powerhouse."
 CRD_moriya_matter_title: "Moriya's Matter"
 CRD_moriya_matter_desc: "Moriya Shrine is the cause of all the religious problems in [Root.GetName]. They gave immense power to our Hell raven, but in return they spread their religion underground and caused great dismay in Former Hell. Additionally, they all did this in order to accelerate their own plans instead of improving our life at all. We need to take complete control of them so that they cannot longer do this nonsense."
 CRD_lazy_hakurei_miko_title: "Scold the lazy Reimu"
 CRD_lazy_hakurei_miko_desc: "The religious split has been solved in our realm. However, it was due to our efforts, NOT the ones of Reimu Hakurei - the person who should be responsible solving issues like that. Instead, they just gave us empty words.\nReimu has already proven to be a lazy shrine maiden. She must pay with her beloved shrine to compensate this laziness."
 CRD_find_koishi_mission_title: "Find Koishi"
 CRD_find_koishi_mission_desc: "Koishi Komeiji is the little sister of Satori and a very free spirit. Like her sister, Koishi is a satori and possesses mind manipulative abilities. However, she disabled them by closing her third eye forever. As a side effect though, she lost the ability to make conscious decisions and acts completely on behalf of her instincts.\nShe vanished then from [Root.GetName] one day until, through pure coincidence, we have found her in the outworld!"

 ###CRD EVENTS###
 flavor_crd.2.t: "Rin Kaenbyou in Egypt"
 flavor_crd.2.desc: "The sun burns down on the hot sand. The air is incredibly dry and the wasteland wherever the eye reaches. For the most people, everything of Egypt, which is not the Nil, is hell. For Rin, it is like a ski vacation though.\nUnder the eternal sand lies a civilization, which was rich in culture and had a whole pantheon of important deities - the deity of Rin's interest, Bastet, especially. Due to long distance between [Root.GetName] and Egypt, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided (on behalf of Rin) to establish an own base in these deserts."
 flavor_crd.2.a: "We will of course support her as good as we can."
 flavor_crd.2.b: "I wonder how a cat life would be in the world largest litter box."
 flavor_crd.2.c: "On a second thought... Orin should stay at home."
 flavor_crd.3.t: "The Oni and [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_crd.3.desc: "The oni used to be our subject only just in name. While they were technically our vassal they were practically a complete autonomous state. This has changed though when we reached our diplomatic hand (with some sake smell too) to them. After hours of discussions and tavern brawls, the oni have decided to support us militarily and become our de facto vassal too. However, they will need quite some time to get used to these new circumstances..."
 flavor_crd.3.a: "These are great news!"
 flavor_crd.3.a.tt: "§Y[ONI.GetName]§! gets a Truce with [Root.GetName] for §Y5 Years§! and §R+150.0%§! Liberty Desire due to the sudden change of power relations."
 flavor_crd.6.t: "Utsuho Reiuji in India"
 flavor_crd.6.desc: "There are four kinds of hell: literally hell, the desert hell, the arctic hell ... and the green hell - and Utsuho has decided for the fourth. While the temperature is not as bad as in Former Hell, the wildlife and the jungles proof to be quite tricky to handle.\nBut it was Utsuho's decision to see out the flame god and as such she organized the establishment of a base in North India."
 flavor_crd.6.a: "Well... she didn't organize it. She let other do it for her."
 flavor_crd.6.b: "I wonder how this bird brain will do in India."
 flavor_crd.6.c: "No. You bird brain should rather stay in the fusion reactor."
 flavor_crd.8.t: "Stubborn Scarlets"
 flavor_crd.8.desc.a: "The Scarlet Devil Mansion is ruled technically under our rule, but practically, it is ruled Remilia Scarlet. Usually it wouldn't make much difference as vassals are just an extension of one's power, but Remilia is not as obedient as a vassal should be - and as such all of the Scarlet Lands refuse to acknowledge the authority of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 flavor_crd.8.desc.b: "The Scarlet Lands are under our control. However, their residents refuse with all means to serve us. They see us as oppressors and will be nothing but dead space to us."
 flavor_crd.8.a: "Accursed be these Scarlets."
 flavor_crd.8.a.tt: "All provinces in the areas §YScarlet Devil Mansion§!, §YScarlet Land§! and §YScarlet Mountain§!, which are owned by us or by our subject, which is not [SCR.GetName], get '§YNot my Mistress§!' until the §YScarlets have been appeased§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Unrest: §R+1.00§!\nMinimum Local Autonomy: §R+95.00§!"
 flavor_crd.8.a.ct: "[SCR.GetName] will refuse to aid [Root.Monarch.GetName] in any wars and will not pay any tribute. This will go until [SCR.Monarch.GetName] and [SCR.Monarch.GetHerHis] family and subjects have been §Yappeased§!."
 flavor_crd.11.t: "Remilia recognizes [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Authority"
 flavor_crd.11.desc.a: "Remilia Scarlet is very pride person, which makes dealing with her really difficult at times. But she respects who are on her level and can hold their ground against her - be it in a danmaku battle, a fight of finesee and diplomacy or the solving of the Scarlet Mist Incident. [Root.Monarch.GetName] managed to outwit her and win against Remilia in any way possible. Ever since, Remilia has become more calmer ... and more childish. Apparently, she feels like a great burden has been lifted of her and now she enjoys her life within the Scarlet Devil Mansion."
 flavor_crd.11.desc.b: "The Scarlet Devil Mansion is like a family - and only members of the family can find their way into it. But through show of strength and carefulness, the residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion slowly learned to accept and even to invite [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Of course the Scarlet Devil won't let go off her pride, but she seems to enjoy her time of less responsibility."
 flavor_crd.11.a: "This vampire really is a pain in the neck..."
 flavor_crd.11.a.tt: "Provinces in §YScarlet Land§!, §YScarlet Mountain§! and §YScarlet Devil Mansion§! owned by us or by any subject will no longer be affected by the modifier '§YNot my Mistress§!'."
 flavor_crd.11.a.ct: "[SCR.GetName] will now be obedient towards [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_crd.12.t: "The Vampire and the Mind Reader"
 flavor_crd.12.desc: "Months have passed since Remilia stepped down as the ruler of Scarlet Realm. Since then, she has started to see more of Gensokyo and even go on or another adventure. Over the time, the once so childish vampire matured... at least personality wise. Due to her development in character, Remilia started to take a more serious tone towards governing the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She started to meet with Satori a lot more recently too. While the chat tends to be rather formal, Satori occasionally taps into Remilia's mind. What might Remilia think about right now?"
 flavor_crd.12.a: "She thinks I am cute."
 flavor_crd.12.b: "She thinks how she should spend more time with her family."
 flavor_crd.13.t: "The little Sisters of Two Dynasties"
 flavor_crd.13.desc: "Unlike Remilia and Satori, the relationship between Flandre and Koishi has always been on friendly terms - even if it is a very unknown friendship. After all, only a handful people can even recognize Koishi so it is no surprise that she always managed to bypass the guard of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and visit her good friend Flandre.\nBefore the conquest of Scarlet Devil Mansion, Koishi spent a lot of time with Flandre, but now she is in a position, where so much weight is on her shoulders and as such the time to play with Flandre has been significantly rarer, which saddens Koishi. However, one day, Koishi stormed into the throne room and had the briliant idea of how to get more play time together! And so, Koishi proposed to Flandre in public, but only the two of them know what's going on while everyone else notice nothing ... well... except for mistress Satori..."
 flavor_crd.13.a: "I just pretend I didn't see Koishi doing this."
 flavor_crd.13.b: "\"Ahem... Koishi...\""
 flavor_crd.14.t: "Remilia remains unimpressed"
 flavor_crd.14.desc: "All of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and its land are under our control ... and yet Remilia keeps sitting on her throne with a taunting smug in her face. She states only one demand: in order for her to acknowledge [Root.Monarch.GetName], she needs to be defeated by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in a personal fight. Until then she sees no reason to follow any of our orders."
 flavor_crd.14.a: "A fight... of course the Scarlet Devil wants a fight..."
 flavor_crd.14.a.tt: "Enable the Diplomatic Danmaku Fight against §YRemilia§!"
 flavor_crd.15.t: "Fight against the Scarlet Devil"
 flavor_crd.15.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] usually avoids direct confrontations and prefers to let work be done through more subtle methods. But Remilia Scarlet is a special case. All mind tricks have failed, any way to appease her just made her more smug and in the end there is only the Danmaku Battle as a way to solve this issue. Although Remilia and [Root.Monarch.GetName] are proud overlords and would never put themselves on the same level as the other, they do still show respect to each other - from mansion owner to mansion owner. As a result of that, the epic battle between these two is in fact a Diplomatic Danmaku Battle."
 flavor_crd.15.a: "Bats like you should have stayed in caves, Remilia."
 flavor_crd.15.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\" between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and Remilia!§!"
 flavor_crd.15.b: "You know what? Words are not enough for her to reach. Danmakus do however."
 flavor_crd.15.b.tt: "§YThis will trigger a Danmaku Fight between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and Remilia!§!"
 flavor_crd.16.t: "Victory over Remilia!"
 flavor_crd.16.desc: "Danmaku and rude words flew through the room constantly, and this for hours. But in the end Remilia had to submit to the mental fortitude and mind reading abilities of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 flavor_crd.16.a: "Finally. Arguing with her was a bore."
 flavor_crd.16.a.tt: "Remilia has been §Ydefeated§! in a Diplomatic Danmaku Fight."
 flavor_crd.17.t: "Defeat against Reamilia"
 flavor_crd.17.desc: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetName] had good attacks, Remilia knew how to counter them just too well. \"You fight like a peasant\" was only contered with Remilia's \"How fitting. You are fighting just lika a cow.\" In the end, it was [Root.Monarch.GetName] who had to submit."
 flavor_crd.17.a: "This is not the end..."
 flavor_crd.17.a.tt: "You can encounter Remilia §Y5 Years§! later again."
 flavor_crd.20.t: "Koishi and the Mask of Hope"
 flavor_crd.20.desc: "Getting the Mask of Hope was an easy task for Satori. After all, what is a tsukumogami to a satori?\nSatori placed the mask on Koishi's table in her room. Like usual, there is no sign of Koishi. Instead, there was a feeling of unease... Satori turned around and saw the table being completely empty again."
 flavor_crd.20.a: "I have a bad feeling now..."
 flavor_crd.20.a.tt: "Koishi is very thankful to Satori."
 ###DETECTIVE SATORI###
 flavor_crd.30.t: "The new Office"
 flavor_crd.30.desc: "There I was, in my new open office. It was just a room in my very own mansion, but I wanted it like so. I need to separate my daily life and my new hobby.\nIt is a neat office. Nothing too fancy - again, I need to separate life and hobby.\nI sit into my chair at the table and look through the pappers lying on it. My cat was so nice and wanted to help, so she collected whatever she could find. Orin is the only one I can trust with this kind of job. Her cat features cause sympathy by humans and youkai alike...\nPff... both are just the worst...\n\nI go through the files, but nothing all too particularly attracts my attention. All things the yama will probably have covered already by now...\nHowever... there is one case, which got my attention. \"BREAKING NEWS - MURDER ATTEMPT AT THE SCARLET DEVIL MANSION!\". It's a tengu newspapper, so the content is always a little bit... creative. But this one -- this seems like a serious case. I should start my career with this one."
 flavor_crd.30.a: "But first, I should talk with Orin."
 flavor_crd.30.a.tt: "Detective Satori will start her very first case!"
 flavor_crd.31.t: "The Detective's Assistant"
 flavor_crd.31.desc: "Standing in my office, my hell cat pet Orin greets me with her most enthusiastic voice pitch she can do. Seems like she is more than eager to help me.\n\"Hellllloooo master! You called me? How can I help you??\" Her good mood is kinda contagious. I have troubles to keep a serious face... \"Yes, I did, my little cat. Did you hear of this incident?\" I hold the files of Scarlet Devil Mansion murder case in my hand. Orin tilts her head as usual when she is getting something asked. \"Nyes, I heard about it. I think their librarian has been hit. No idea how though.\" Orin replied. \"That's why I called you. I need somebody who can go to the mansion on my half and talk with the residents.\" I could go there myself, but I have a realm to take care of too... and honestly, I don't want to hear the judging minds of the vampire and her lackeys unless I absolutely need to.\nOrin meows. \"Okaaay. I will do this for you! You can count on me, master!\""
 flavor_crd.31.a: "What a good cat."
 flavor_crd.32.t: "Orin Report - Interview with the SDM"
 flavor_crd.32.desc: "Sitting in the office and enjoying some good water. For some reason, everyone assumes a detective should be some kind of drunkard. Hmpf... stereotypes.\n\n<Master will be very happy with what I found!!> I hear the mind of somebody, approaching my office. It can only be-\n\"MAAAAASTERRR! I bring news!\" \"Oh, what did you find, Orin?\"\nOrin goes into long detail about how she has talked with the residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. I glance out of the window while she talks. And talks. And talks. I wish she would be more on point with her explanations, but oh well... that happens if you send somebody else on your behalf for the interviews...\nHowever, she still brings some good clues about the attempted murder of §BPatchouli Knowledge§!. At the location of the crime, the §GLibrary§!, Orin found a §Rbunch of books§! lying on the floor - like somebody tried to find a specific tome.\nAt the table where Patchouli sat, there is a §Rbroken cup with remaining coffee§! - probably the murder weapon.\nIn an interview with §BMeiling Hong§!, it got revealed that there has been no known visitor in the mansion during the incident - but well, Meiling was asleep during the events according to her. However, she also notes how §BRemilia Scarlet§! liked to spend a lot of time with Patchouli and that §BSakuya Izayoi§! could have felt §Rneglected§!.\nAfterwards, my pet talked with §BReimu Hakurei§! and §BMarisa Kirisame§!, but nothing of value came out of this interview except that Marisa might have been interested in the §Rbooks of the library§! and that Reimu was complaining about a §Rlack of donations§! in recent times.."
 flavor_crd.32.a: "§TMarisa§! is a book thief. To get away with her theft, she murders Patchouli."
 flavor_crd.32.a.tt: "Rin Kaenbyou will accuse §TMarisa Kirisame§! for the murder attempt on Patchouli Knowledge."

Apparently, Orin wanted me to read them... hmm...\n\"FAIRY NATIONALISM RISES - CIRNO DEMANDS RIGHTS FOR FAIRIES\" Apparently, the little vassal Remilia has is getting ballsy ... and reckless. This ice fairy has enough of her and her people being \"subjugated by the evil vampire\". The last time I checked, all the fairies in the Scarlet Devil Mansion were oficially hired and only the violent faires stayed out and became vassals.\nEhh... whatever. I wasn't thinking too much about this article until out of the sudden I found a little detail on the image of the newspaper. §BCirno§! was holding a frozen, §RGolden poison frog§! - its poison is easily capable of killing somebody with heart failure..."

 flavor_crd.34.t: "The great Accusation"
 flavor_crd.34.desc.a: "Another day at the office. Former Hell is going well at least and nothing of too much of concern is happening - perfect conditions to hear the report Orin is giving me now. I told her to accuse §BMarisa§! in front of all the suspects. The shock was, of course, big.\nWhen Orin announced it was Marisa, the suspects went into a heated discussion - and Marisa was of course defending herself as good as she could. But these books on the ground don't lie. In the night of the murder attempt, Marisa prepared a coffee with one of the many poisonous mushrooms of the Forest of Magic and entered the library. Because Meiling was sleeping at her job, she had it quite easy. Her goal was actually to take some books and leave, but Patchouli stood in her way. Instead of a danmaku fight, which could have caught the attention of the other residents, Marisa decided to use one of her poisons and sold it as a good coffee for Patchouli. They talked with each other until Patchouli fall into a coma - the perfect chance to get away with the books.\nOf course Marisa denied the accusation Orin made, but it was too late and she was thrown into the basement."

I told her to accuse §BReimu§! in front of all the suspects. The shock was, of course, big.\nWhen Orin announced it was Reimu, the suspects gasped. However, I doubt Reimu was the true killer but was just hired to murder - another youkai hunting contract to get her donation box full. She flew into the mansion, bursted into the library - the reason for the books on the ground - and interrupted Patchouli during her coffee break. Before she was able to react, Reimu used one of her special danmakus to instantly kill Patchouli.\nUnfortunately for her, Patchouli survived and now the truth came out - and worst of all for her: her donation box will remain empty as she gets thrown into the basement."

The very house maid, who keeps everything in the mansion in check is the assaulter on Patchouli. She had the means as she can stop time and prepares all the food and drinks of the mansion. She has a reason as she grew jealous of the friendship between her mistress and Patchouli and she had the opportunities as Patchouli is always alone in the library. Sakuya couldn't even defend herself and got quickly thrown into the basement."

How could have a dumb fairy done this? What they forget is that Cirno and her fairy accomplices have been trying to become independent for quite some time and a act of terror against the Scarlet Devil Mansion would be the message a fairy would send. Additionally, fairies are small and easy to overlook them AND Cirno has access to poisonous frogs - means, reasons and opportunies exist for her.\nCirno got quickly persecuted and has been thrown into the basement ever since."

However, additoinally of consuming a Diplomatic Relation, Satori's Vassals also take one spot of §BVassal Upkeep§!.

 flavor_scr.6.desc.a: "With our military superiority and the finesse of [Root.Monarch.GetName], we managed to take control over the throne of [CRD.GetName], the rulers of Former Hell. However, despite our clear superiority, Satori and Koishi Komeiji don't recognize the might of our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. And as such all of our demands for support only meet on deaf ears. While Remilia could manipulate fate and force them to serve, it would just cause a long term problem with the residents of Former Hell.\nNo, to gain the support of the [CRD.GetAdjective] they need a proof that we treat the Komeijis with the highest respect and try our best to appease them."
 flavor_scr.6.desc.b: "With the fall of [CRD.GetName], the invasion into Former Hell was an easy task. However, the residents of that region have proven to be quite resistent towards [Root.GetAdjective] authority. While the Komeijis might be technically their leaders anymore, the inhabitants of Former Hell still hear the word of hers more than ours. If we want to get control over the situation we need to convince them of ourselves. This also means we need to appease the two great satoris, who are still lurking in the Former Hell's shadows."

However, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven her, that our realm has best of intentions for the people of Former Hell and for her family. At first the mind reader didn't want to believe it, but our efforts to increase the security of Chireiden, to support Koishi in her quest and to help the residents of Former Hell have left a good impression of us.\nAfter several hours of talk, the Komeijis have declared ready to step down of the throne of Former Hell and allow [Root.Monarch.GetName] to get in charge!"
 flavor_scr.9.desc.b: "The residents of Former Hell are distrustful creatures and our conquest of their home didn't increase their opinion of us at all.

After all, only a handful people can even recognize Koishi so it is no surprise that she always managed to bypass the guard of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and visit her good friend Flandre.\nBefore the conquest of Chireiden, Flandre had plenty of time to spend with Koishi, but now she is in a position, where so much weight is on her shoulders and as such the time to play with Koishi has been significantly rarer, which saddens Koishi. However, one day, Koishi stormed into the throne room and had the briliant idea of how to get more play time together! And so, Koishi proposed to Flandre in public, but only the two of them know what's going on while everyone else notice nothing ..."

It was quite the surprise for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to see her in the court room out of the sudden of course as Patchouli usually avoided politics too. But because of our mistress' help in her many experiments (and maybe because of one comment too many about her body weight), she decided to join [Root.Monarch.GetName] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] political business and support our realm with her advises."

With 111 meters in height and over 2,938 tons, this behemoth of a missile has pierced the sky and reached the moon within under a week. Of course for Remilia this is really slow, but for the several hundreds of our vampiric colonists, this was a quick time.\nWhen the rocket landed on the moon, it immediately got a visit from curious moon rabbits. At first they appeared to be friendly, but when a weird noise appeared, the rabbits immediately opened fire. Fortunately our colonists are expert fighters and slaughtered these treacherous rabbits and enacted a counter attack, which disabled the lunar defenses.\nWe came to the moon as visitors, but got treated as invaders. There weren't many reasons for us to conquer the moon, but their hostility showed us that they are a threat to our realm and all life of Earth!"

Be it in the frontline or in the briefing rooms - [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows of the struggle of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] warriors... and their bloodlust. Unlike our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], our soldiers are reveling in the heat of the battle and enjoy the combat even if they fall on the battlefield. While [Root.Monarch.GetName] does not share their enthusiasm, their blood lust, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors have made a plan to restructure the government to support their morale with the charisma of our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nThey also point out that with the establishment of a 'Scarlet Monarchy', our neighbors will have a better idea who they are dealing with and would even be ready to trust us."

Just trees and wild life. Remilia looks confused at the sight. Sakuya notes to have a strange feeling of oddity ... as if they are too soon at this place.

In order to avoid public attention, Remilia hid her wings in her attire.\nUpon their arrival, they got greeted by a polite butler. He seemed to recognize Sakuya... but at the same time he couldn't tell why.\nThe two girls entered the mansion and met with a noble merchant, who at first was worried because of the invited guests, but soon started to get along quite well with Remilia. It appears the man is one of the many aspiring aristocrats of the British Islands and has yet to learn a lot about being a gentleman. He too had an odd feeling of familiarity upon seeing Sakuya face, but just like the butler, he couldn't tell why.\nAfter a lengthy afternoon of chatting and enjoying tea, the vampire and her maiden came to no conclusion whatsoever and left the nobleman with a hearty farewell. In the carriage, Sakuya noted that they were too early. But she was happy to see the ancestors of her better half of her family..."

This all changed when Christianity spread through Europe though and quicky after that, every supernatural being - be it rightfully or not - has been hunted down to extinction. All in the name of the Christian beliefs and the Pope! But now the tables have turned and the Pope is at our mercy! As we all know, mercy is the mark of a great woman."

Flandre and Koishi were always good friends, and now, after their sisters left their thrones, their realms became great allies too."

 HKR_explore_eastern_indian_ocean_desc: "The Barrier is lost and it is uncertain if we will ever manage to restore it to protect Gensokyo.

 FOM_breach_to_the_lake_desc: "In the Misty Lake lies an island, which holds the infamous Scarlet Devil Mansion. The mansion has a huge library filled with magical tomes useful for our nation. However, some of those books are not easy to transport and won't survive a long flight.

 FOM_get_full_access_to_voile_library_desc: "In the Scarlet Mansion there's a huge library full of magical tomes, books with ancient knowledge and even some forbidden writings. Usually Marisa could always 'borrow' some of these books but with the recent events everyone in Gensokyo became more tense and Marisa has lost her access to the library. Perhaps it is time to change our method: instead of borrowing the books we annex the library and with it the Scarlet Devil Mansion directly to our realm."
 FOM_rinnosukes_shop_title: "Rinnosuke's Shop"
 FOM_rinnosukes_shop_desc: "If there is good price, we are glad to pay money for books and materials too. In the north next to the Human Capital there's Kourindou, or better known as the shop of Rinnosuke Morichika. Rinnosuke is an expert in identifying the true value of treasures we loot and pays us a good amount of money, but the people of the Human Capital started to isolate themselves, which makes trading with Rinnosuke difficult.

 FOM_unite_gensokyos_humans_desc: "While some magicians are born as magical youkai, most of the witches and mages are or were humans, which means that our realm is bound to the Gensokyan humans.

This Elixir has the ability to grant its consumer immortality, but it is lost and all knowledge about that were kept secret - until now. According to Eirin's notes and the books from the Voile Library the Elixir can only be brewed on a place where the air is extremely thin. One of these places is the Youkai Mountain in Gensokyo. We should establish a laboratory there."
 FOM_results_of_magic_and_technology_title: "Magic and Technology"
 FOM_results_of_magic_and_technology_desc: "The lab is finished, but the environment doesn't satisfy the requirements for the Elixir - even though it is the mountain with the thinnest air! Fortunately, there are people who could help us out: the Kappa in the west have advanced technology, which they use for incredible things like sucking air from the environment, but they're completely unorganized and until they find the machines we need we would've already died from age.\nAlternatively we can hijack the space vessel of Okazaki. Her technology is on par with those of the kappas, but she won't give it to us on her own. Either way, we need to take control over either realm and reorganize them for our purpose."

 FOM_overthrow_mima_desc: "There is an ancient ghost in the north. This ghost is nobody but Mima herself, the teacher of many magicians and witches - her most well known apprentice was Marisa Kirisame. According to Marisa, Mima is... a difficult person and master, but her controversial teaching methods worked. However someday she disappeared without any reason, but now she is back and proclaims an \"empire\" on Gensokyo and has built a large undead army. It is unknown what her plan is nor if she is sane, but it is better when we strike now instead of waiting for the answer."

 FOM_annex_makai_desc: "Just like Marisa, Alice was trained by an ancient master of magic too. In her case the old goddess Shinki, master of Makai, was her teacher and, similar to Mima, Shinki used rather strict teaching methods. Now Shinki watches over her realm which contains dangerous miasma and raw magic.\nAlice grew up there under the care of Shinki. Years have passed since Alice left her old home of Makai, but she is still a legitimate Makaian and the closest relative to Shinki, which gives Alice a justified claim on the throne of Makai... and its plentiful doll workshops."

 FOM_defeat_shinki_title: "Shinki, Master of Dolls"
 FOM_defeat_shinki_desc: "While the throne of Makai is a certain power boost to our own power, it is not our only target in this region. Shinki, the very goddess who created this world and taught Alice the art of creating dolls, still lurks in the depths of her palace. Alice needs to meet with her in order to learn the highly advanced doll control techniques Shinki has developed, but she is a very stubborn goddess. The only way to convince her to help is by showing [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s superiority in a Danmaku Duel against her powered-up maiden Yumeko."

 FOM_stop_yukaris_shenanigans_title: "Yukari's Shenanigans"
 FOM_stop_yukaris_shenanigans_desc: "Yukari Yakumo is single handedly responsible for many incidents which happned in Gensokyo. Although it is just because of her Gensokyo exists in the first place, her shenanigans are still a threat to everyone. We should remind her that her job is protecting Gensokyo from the Outside threat and not to endanger it."

 FOM_take_control_over_the_shrine_desc: "The Hakurei Clan was always a close ally for us. While they guarded the religious and military safety of Gensokyo our realm grew. Now it is time for this Clan to hand their duties over to us and become a part of our mighty nation."

 FOM_create_an_empire_desc: "Gensokyo has changed. Since the destruction of the Hakurei Barrier and the exposing of Gensokyo to the Outside the relations between all the realms are more tense than ever and everyone seeks a victory over its neighbour. In these unstable times only the most adapted nation can withstand the test of time. Let us create an empire, which shall not only pass this test but also guarantee the safety of all magic wielders and humans of Gensokyo!"
 FOM_start_the_quest_title: "Hunt After Immortality"
 FOM_start_the_quest_desc: "With both threats from Yuuka and Yukari removed and with the establishment of the laboratory on Youkai Mountain we can finally start our research for immortality - and with the notes from the Bamboo Forest and the books from the Scarlet Devil Mansion it may be possible to create a new Hourai Elixir, the potion of immortality..."

 FOM_flask_from_the_tenno_desc: "To create a new Hourai Elixir we need the old, empty flask. Although neither Kaguya, the princess who let the potion be made and drank it, nor Eirin, the creator of said potion, know where the flask is.

 FOM_seouls_brewing_stand_desc: "In Eirin's notes it is written that she has lost her brewing stand on her way to Gensokyo.

 FOM_magical_gold_title: "Find the Magical Gold"
 FOM_magical_gold_desc: "According to the notes the Hourai Elixir needs Magical Gold as catalyst. While Magical Gold may exist on the moon here on the normal world it is nowhere to find. However some books from the Voile Library tells from legends of Chinese alchemists who observed special features of the gold from one of China's gold mines. This gold mine may be worth a look..."
 FOM_magical_silk_shell_title: "Anti-Magical Silk Shell"
 FOM_magical_silk_shell_desc: "The Hourai Elixir may contain by the moment of its creation way too much magic for a human body to handle. We have to find a way to weaken the magic potential of the potion. Eirin used for her potion moon silk, but you can't find this on earth - or at least we thought it. Rumours tell that a special silk from the Bengal Delta absorbs water, fire effects and even physical hits. It is probably a story told by some crazed guru, but you never know..."
 FOM_lunar_stone_first_half_title: "Acquire the Moon Sapphire"
 FOM_lunar_stone_first_half_desc: "In order to give the elixir the needed magical power two moon stones are required: the Moon Sapphire and Moon Ruby. Both got lost as Kaguya arrived on Earth and nobody remembers where they are now. According to Patchouli's tomes for magical items 2 strange stones appeared in Europe at the same time. The Europeans call them \"Philosopher Stones\". The blue Philosopher Stone is currently locked under the Notre Dame in Paris. Time for a church visit..."

 FOM_gilgameshs_plant_title: "Epic of Gilgamesh"
 FOM_gilgameshs_plant_desc: "Eirin's notes report besides the usual ingredients for a potion one special ingredient: an extremely rare herb in Mesopotania. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells from Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, and his story how he seeked out for this herb to achieve immortality too. Patchouli's version of the Epic even describes very clearly how and where we can find it. Where the legendary king failed shall we succeed... or did he achieve his goal after all?"
 FOM_greek_fire_title: "Recreate the Greek Fire"
 FOM_greek_fire_desc: "One final ingredient is a \"flame, so hot it burns even on water, so alive it will never be extinguished\". Obviously the fire represents the new life energy of its consumer, but the fire Eirin used is unknown. However old writings note that the Byzantine Empire used flames which resembles the Hourai Fire a lot. With a bit of luck our witches could find some old recipes for this Greek Fire in Constantinople."

 FOM_recruit_ellen_desc: "Before Marisa moved to the South with her friend Reimu, she used to live near the Old Hakurei Shrine. Marisa even had an own magicshop there, but when she and the magician decided to move she sold it to a witch called \"Ellen\".\nYears have passed since this arrangement and Marisa and Alice have built their own realm within Gensokyo, which is now thriving and prospering.

Due to the arcane powers of the forest this statue has become sentient and is today the person Narumi Yatadera, a skillful magician.\nShe is quite friendly towards Marisa and Alice, but she is hard to motivate to be more involved in the business of the Forest of Magic. We should show sincerity of guaranteeing her home’s safety and prosperity."
 FOM_byakurens_magic_title: "Byakuren's Magic Scrolls"
 FOM_byakurens_magic_desc: "Byakuren Hijiri might be a devout monk, but she is also a magician, who learnt the one or another trick from her friend Shinki! However, she is not too eager to share her spells with us as she thinks these scrolls should be used for the Buddhistic faith.\nTo our luck though, the Myouren Temple has seen a withdrawal from donations. She might be more willing to give one of her scrolls to us if we pay her a nice sum of Ducats.\nAlternatively, we could search them for ourself if we \"borrow\" some land of her realm."

 FOM_recruit_mai_and_yuki_desc: "While Marisa's connection to the past is through Reimu and Ellen, Alice's past is more intimate. While Shinki is famously related to her, Alice had also tight connections with the court witches Mai and Yuki. Now with Alice in control of Makai again, these two witches are more than needed to maintain control over this strange world.\nBut first, the palace needs some major upgrades before Alice can consulate with Mai and Yuki."

 FOM_peace_between_witches_and_foresters_desc: "While our realm is ruled by the magicians, a great portion of our country is resident of youkai, who are too powerless to rule a nation on their own.

 FOM_rumia_of_the_forest_title: "Re-educate Rumia"
 FOM_rumia_of_the_forest_desc: "Rumia's eating behavior caused serious issues with our human neighbours - and our magicians agree that this can't last any longer. If we don't want a massive human army invading the forest of magic we need to teach Rumia that a less humanoid diet is better for her. Instead she should enjoy the sweet taste of honey and sugar from the Land of the Back Door."
 FOM_mystias_food_center_title: "Tiny Spices for Mystia"
 FOM_mystias_food_center_desc: "Gensokyo only has a handful of spice producers, but none of them can compare to these the Inchlings are able to make with their Miracle Mallet.

 FOM_uniting_the_foresters_title: "Unite the Forest"
 FOM_uniting_the_foresters_desc: "Rumia, Mystia and Wriggle all stood in front of Marisa and asked for one last favor for them: the unification of the great forest of Gensokyo. They claim that under the supervision of us magicians the youkai are living a so much better life. While Marisa is skeptical that the other youkai would be fond of becoming part of our great realm, she can't decline this wish. Especially since a unified, Grand Forest of Magic means easier access to rare magical ingredients."
 FOM_razing_and_looting_witch_title: "Razing and Plunder"
 FOM_razing_and_looting_witch_desc: "Our great witch Marisa is a lovely person, but she has one big flaw: she has cleptomania. While that's not a good trait for diplomacy, it is a very handy behavior during war time. It went so far that even many of our own witches have copied this behavior. But we can't blame them.

 FOM_build_doll_factory_title: "Build Doll Factories"
 FOM_build_doll_factory_desc: "Although an army made out of magicians is quite powerful, it very limited. We are only that many witches and mages after all. Fortunately, our respected second leader, Alice Margatroid, has the power of creating and controlling dolls, which can do the fighting instead. Therefore strengthening her controlling power and technique will be on our schedule. First we should start with building more doll factories."
 FOM_butterfly_dream_pill_title: "Butterfly Dream Pill"
 FOM_butterfly_dream_pill_desc: "Alice used to purchase a certain medicine: Butterfly Dream Pill from Eientei.

 CRD_improve_oni_relations_desc: "Not all inhabitants of Former Hell were intended to be here. Of course there is our kind - the satoris - who have found their way in here. But there are also the savage oni, once lords of the Youkai Mountains. It all changed when the Tengu attacked.\nDespite having lost everything they had, the oni are more than content with their exclave in Former Hell, and as their form of \"rent\" they pay us yearly a tribute.\nThey could be a much more useful asset to us though, but it will not only take a few nice words but also enough alcohol for the whole oni civilization. Luckily, Reimu has a whole storage town. We just need to seit it from her."

However, our realm has the unique ability to move through not only uncolonized land but also through land which is occupied by another country. By getting a claim on a foreign province, which borders our capital, our capital will automatically move to this claimed province and return the old province to its original owner. The claim (and the city movement) will be nullified if we either claim during war or if we claim a foreign capital.\nOf course the development, religion and culture of the province before our immigration will be restored while the new province will get our primary culture, religion and our development.\nDeveloping the capital is permanent and will be transferred to the new province should the city move. Additionally, we can grow the development through §Bconquest§!. Every province we conquer will have its development saved as an invisible variable and will be immediately returned to the owner. [Root.GetName] can then make this development \"real\" by \"coring\" it - done through a decision. Each development costs 5 £adm£ to core, but it is instantly. Province, which development have been saved as a variable gain \"Koishi's Mark\", making them unavailable for saving their development again.\nFinally, no country can fabricate a claim on us."
