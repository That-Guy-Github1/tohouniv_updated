 HIG_recruit_oni_strike_force_title: "Recruit the Oni Army"
 HIG_recruit_oni_strike_force_desc: "Ever since their loss of the Youkai Mountain, the oni have become residents of Hell and Former Hell. While the oni in Hell are designated to torture the damned, they also have a duty as the army of [Root.GetName]. We should either contact the local kishin to rally the oni, or get in touch with the Oni Exiles to get either support."
 hig_disable_all_previous_reforms_tt: "Convert all §YImperial Yama Privileges§! into a single one §YReform§!."
 HIG_reorganize_the_shinigami_title: "Reorganize the Shinigami"
 HIG_reorganize_the_shinigami_desc: "The shinigami are responsible for ferrying the souls to Higan in order for them to be judged. In theory that is.\nDue to the many privileges Komachi managed to get from Hecatia for the shinigami, the influx of new souls has come to a near standstill. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] respects free days and vacations, but their behavior is endangering the whole flow of the afterlife. We need to get revoke their privileges!"
 HIG_deal_with_komachis_slack_title: "Revoke the Slacking"
 HIG_deal_with_komachis_slack_desc: "After ensuring the accountability of the shinigami, it is time now for revoking the last privilege, which allows the shinigami to slack from their work."
 HIG_improve_hells_infrastructure_title: "Improve Hell's Infrastructure"
 HIG_improve_hells_infrastructure_desc: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not only highest judge of the dead, but also vice ruler of Hell. As such, it is our utter most priority to maintain and improve the infrastructure in Hell in order for keeping the sinners locked up and punished.\nBoth can be achieved relatively simple by constructing workshops, which serve as the prison cells for the damned, as well as their eternal torture as workforces."
 HIG_improve_hells_infrastructure_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gets a permanent claim on the §YFormer Hell§! region and a §YSubjugation§! casus belli against §YChireiden§! if the mission '§YThe Land of the Dead§!' is completed."

 HIG_take_over_chireiden_title: "Take over Former Hell"
 HIG_take_over_chireiden_desc: "Former Hell was once our realm of operation. But due to the sheer overpopulation of evil spirits, demons and other creatures of the underworld, Higan needed to expand. Due to the bureaucratic issues, Eiki Shiki, Supreme Judge of Gensokyo, then decided split Higan into two regions: Hell and Former Hell.\nWhile Higan was ruled by Eiki, Former Hell was under direct control of Hecatia. But the goddess preferred to have somebody else doing her work, and so she decided to drop the claim entirely, turning Former Hell into a battle field between the satoris, the onis and the spirits.\n\nEventually, Satori Komeiji seized power over Former Hell and became its absolute ruler. Despite all these events, Former Hell still is sovereign territory of [Root.GetName]. We should remind Satori about that."
 HIG_take_over_chireiden_tt: "The event §Y'Judge and Jury'§! happens if we have a subject country, which is or used to be §Y[CRD.GetName]§!."
 HIG_side_with_a_shrine_maiden_title: "Appoint Religious Head"
 HIG_side_with_a_shrine_maiden_desc: "Gensokyo is the target of many antagonistic forces, who try to to tip the balance of power to their favor by all means. These beings cause continental incidents, which bring only chaos and discord to the mortals and youkai alike. Fortunately, there are shrine maidens and religious heads, who resolve these incidents as fast as possible - most notably Reimu Hakurei.\nHowever, incidents are only one issue. The other is the utter religious chaos reigning in Gensokyo. We will have to side with one of the great religions if we want to bring unity to the continent."
 HIG_remove_tenshi_from_heaven_title: "Remove Tenshi from Power"
 HIG_remove_tenshi_from_heaven_desc: "While it is our duty to govern Hell, the celestials inhabit Heaven and ensure its stabilty and well being. Usually, the yama don't interfere with the business of the celestials, but for reasons unknown to us, Tenshi Hinanawi has become the leader of Heavenly Realm. Her selfish and irresponsible nature is not only a liability to Heaven, but also a threat to Gensokyo as a whol!\nAlthough it is not the yama way to fiddle with the high heavens, it is still our duty as peacekeeper of Gensokyo to remove the threat Tenshi represents."
 HIG_remove_tenshi_from_heaven_tt: "§Y[HVR.Capital.GetName]§! is controlled by §Y[Root.GetName]§! or its §YAllies§! or §YSubjects§!."

 HIG_handle_the_gang_wars_title: "Handle the Gang Wars"
 HIG_handle_the_gang_wars_desc: "The eastern part of Hell is the well known Animal Realm, which is inhabited by the spirits of the deceased animals. For the most part, the Animal Realm has been reigned by three \"gangs\" which are ruling by the rule of the strongest.\nThe great Yamaxanadu has rarely reason to meddle with the strife of the Matriarchs. However, when when word reached Eiki that the gang leaders are enslaving the human spirits in order to create an army, as well as the involvement of a goddess to subdue the gang leaders, it became clear to our realm that Animal Realm needs to be governed by the yama instead of these animals."
 HIG_stablize_the_animal_realms_title: "Stabalize the Animal Realm"
 HIG_stablize_the_animal_realms_desc: "The Animal Realm in the east has been in constant distress due to the gang wars. Now that we control most part of these lands, it is time to repair the damage these matriarchs have done to Hell."
 HIG_integrate_kutaka_title: "The Land of the Dead"
 HIG_integrate_kutaka_desc: "Muenzuka - also known as Mound of the Nameless - is the graveyard of the unfortunate humans, who died without relatives or are outlanders who stranded in Gensokyo. This graveyard as well as the lands around it are protected by our gate keepter Kutaka. With the consolidation of the Animal Realm, however, the gate keeper has more urgent roles to fill, and as such it is in everyone's best interests if Muenzuka and the Land of the Dead is in [Root.GetAdjective] hands."
 HIG_integrate_kutaka_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gets a permanent claim on the §YFormer Hell§! region and a §YSubjugation§! casus belli against §YChireiden§! if the mission '§YImprove Hell's Infrastructure§!' is completed."
 HIG_show_yukaris_place_title: "Scold the Gap Youkai"
 HIG_show_yukaris_place_desc: "The gap youkai Yukari Yakumo has always been a thorn in the side to the Ministry of Right and Wrong. Admittedly, she and the other two sages are responsible for the creation of Gensokyo in the first place, but neither of them saw it as necessary to regulate youkai society nor to enforce the laws these very sages have created in the first place.\nIt is time to teach humility and responsibility to the gap youkai."
 HIG_resolve_the_immortal_conflict_title: "The Immortal Rivals"
 HIG_resolve_the_immortal_conflict_desc: "Death is the fate of all living beings and a crucial part of the balance of the universe. Yet there are two rivals who defy the peace of death itself. Kaguya and Mokou are these mentioned immortal rivals, who kill each other on a daily basis. Due to their immortal status, there is no reason to lecture them in the first place - after all they will never reach the Grand Courtroom in the first place.\nThere is one issue though: their constant deaths irritate the shinigami of Higan. Whenever either of them gets slain, the shinigami get a notification through their senses, which result in their departure to obtain the new soul. When they reach the \"corpse\", however, they find a living a breathing immortal instead, wasting the shinigami's time. We have to end their daily brawls once and for all."
 HIG_hire_yama_advisors_title: "Advisors for the Court"
 HIG_hire_yama_advisors_desc: "Although the Yamaxanadu is the ruler of hell, the position's role is first and foremost to judge the deceased. Because of that, our realm always needs at least one or two competent advisors to ensure the stability of hell."
 HIG_take_over_the_road_of_liminality_title: "Connect the Road"
 HIG_take_over_the_road_of_liminality_desc: "The Road of Liminality is the crossroad between Gensokyo and Hell. As such many spirits and ghosts as well as living beings pass this road. Eventually, the road has become a hub of trade between the living and the dead.\nBut not all merchants are coming to this place in good faith. We should seize control over this road and ensure that the scamming ghosts are sent back to hell."
 HIG_move_the_ministry_to_gensokyo_title: "Create a new Ministry"
 HIG_move_the_ministry_to_gensokyo_desc: "The Ministry of Right and Wrong is the political institution which is responsible for the government and administration of all dimensions of hell. It's also the organization, which creates the laws and rules which are used to judge a soul. The yama are direct subordinates of this ministry and our actions are the will of the 10 Kings of the Ministry.\nBut their influence was not meant to be forever. The 10 Kings are exceptional judges, but their sense for economy has been severely lacking. Eventually, the kings pawned Higan and their other territories in Gensokyo to Hecatia. It is clear that the once mighty Ministry of Right and Wrong is a shell of what it once was. It is time to establish our Ministry!"
 HIG_take_control_over_netherworld_title: "The Spirit Princess"
 HIG_take_control_over_netherworld_desc: "The realms of the after life are split into three major regions: Heaven for those who lived a content and compassionate life; Hell for the sinners who lived a malicious life at the cost of others; and Netherworld for the guiltless who desire to achieve nirvana or to be reincarnated.\nThe mistress of Netherworld is Yuyuko Saigyouji, a subordinate of the great Yamaxanadu - though this relationship is very much onesided. While we provide Netherworld resources and protection, all what the Spirit Princess did was threaten the balance of Gensokyo. It is time to remind Yuyuko that she still is a subject to the Yama Authority."
 hig_has_return_hecatia_war_cb_flag_tt: "Enables a casus bell against §Y[HEC.GetName]§!."
 HIG_hecatia_and_eiki_title: "Return Hecatia to Higan"
 HIG_hecatia_and_eiki_desc: "Hecatia Lapislazuli - an eccentric goddess, de jure ruler of all Hells and one of the old deities from the Outworld. While she is technically the authority above the great Yamaxanadu, Hecatia prefers to spend her time to be the advisor of the Yamaxanadu instead.\nHowever, she has been on vacations, and has been seen lastly on the moon, where she helps a being of pure rage and fury to eradicate the lunarians. These vacations are now on going for literal decades, and there seems to be no sign for her return to Higan. The time has come for Hecatia to finally return to Higan and retake her role as important advisor of Hell."
 HIG_hecatia_and_eiki_tt: "§Y[HEC.GetName]§! (or the owner of §Y[5324.GetName]§! if [HEC.GetName] does not exist) has lost a war against [Root.GetName] and was subject to the '§YReturn from Vacations§!' peace treaty."

 HIG_improve_the_sanzu_river_income_title: "Sanzu's Riverbanks"
 HIG_improve_the_sanzu_river_income_desc: "The Sanzu River is the mist-shrouded river that dead souls must cross in order to reach Higan, where they will await judgment. While only the dead can cross the river itself, the riverbank is a major attraction point for youkai, humans, living and undead alike.\nWe should develop the infrastructure of the riverbanks and establish a fort for the shinigami in order to protect the travellers on this place."
 HIG_establish_hig_fleet_title: "Fleet of the Judicator"
 HIG_establish_hig_fleet_desc: "Gensokyo has been separated from the Outworld ever since the creation of the Hakurei Barrier. This brought peace within the continent while also protected it from the humans who are all too eager to set foot on Gensokyo. But as fortunate wanted it, the barrier cracked and broke. Not only broke this the fragile peace within Gensokyo but also made the Outworld aware of our existence. We should construct a fleet in order to protect our home from invaders."
 HIG_beyond_the_barrier_title: "Beyond the Barrier"
 HIG_beyond_the_barrier_desc: "Although our priority lies in the protection of Gensokyo, the Outworld still contains mysteries which are too compelling to us to be ignored. We should send a small fleet to discover what lies behind the remains of the Hakurei Barrier, and explore the wonders of the world."
 HIG_the_jizo_of_japan_title: "The Jizo of Japan"
 HIG_the_jizo_of_japan_desc: "All great Yamaxanadus used to be jizo statues, which gained enough faith to become sentient. These jizos then got selected by the Ten Kings in order to become the yama we know today.\nDue to the financial bankruptcy of the former Ten Kings, the Ministry of Right and Wrong fell in Hecatia's care. As a result, there has been a lack of new yamas to cover the exponential growth of the souls which need judgement. Hecatia promised to take care of it, but her eccentric nature makes her quite unreliable. It would be wise if we take matters in our own hands and get access to the greatest source of new jizos in Japan."
 HIG_the_way_of_buddhism_title: "The Way of Buddhism"
 HIG_the_way_of_buddhism_desc: "Many aspects of Gensokyan culture and religion have their roots in Buddhism. Many of the laws and rules we have to use for our judgements are based on Buddhistic virtues. We should get into contact with the important religious centers for each of the Buddhistic branches."
 HIG_discover_the_middle_east_title: "Push Westwards"
 HIG_discover_the_middle_east_desc: "Our superior, Hecatia, is not native to Gensokyo but comes from the far west. Of course our utter most priority still lies in Gensokyo, but there is a certain curiosity to her origins. We should dispatch a small fleet to discover the home lnad of the goddess of Hell."
 HIG_discover_the_middle_east_tt: "Allow the one time purchase of the island §Y[1099.GetName]§! through a decision."
 HIG_discover_europe_title: "Discover Europe"
 HIG_discover_europe_desc: "The eternal deserts are - with the exception of a few settlements and the one or another oasis - completely devoid of life. All what we were able to find was sand and the one or another tomb.\nHowever, it seems we are getting close as the local humans mentioned \"Greeks\", which are the supposed people Hecatia once served for. We have to traverse the desert and push even further west."
 HIG_lecture_the_bad_title: "Lecture the Evil"
 HIG_lecture_the_bad_desc: "The rulers of the different realms of Gensokyo are ambitious. This in itself is not a problem, but their behavior, which is a result of their ambitions, is problematic for the balance of Gensokyo. We have to lecture those who do bad, and grant the grace to those who will bring justice."
 HIG_appoint_competent_executor_title: "The Astral Executor"
 HIG_appoint_competent_executor_desc: "Long before the creation of Former Hell, the Ten Kings hold territory in Gensokyo which is today known as \"Old Hell\". As it was a time long before the first Yamaxanadu, there is not much known about this area nor when the switch from Old Hell to Former Hell happened. For all we know is that Old Hell is now owned by an ancient protector of Hell: the Astral Knight Konngara.\nIt just happens to be that we are looking for an Executor who shall embody the long Arm of Justice. Konngara would be an excellent choice for this role."
 HIG_peace_freedom_justice_and_security_title: "Separation of Power"
 HIG_peace_freedom_justice_and_security_desc: "We have the important task to maintain peace, freedom, justice and security in Gensokyo. However, if we truly want to achieve this goal we should ensure that no realm grows too powerful. It is easier for us to project our authority against many smaller states than few grand nations."

 HIG_afterlive_of_the_deserts_title: "Desert's Rites"
 HIG_afterlive_of_the_deserts_desc: "Long before the Islam emerged in the Middle East, the ancient Kingdom of Egypt worshipped many more than one god. In their panthenon there is one goddess in particular who strikes similarities in our kind: the ancient goddess Maat. Unfortunately, the Roman and later the Muslim conquest of the Middle East ensured the destruction of all the writings about the ancient Egyptian deities. But not all is lost! In the obscure place of [360.GetName] there is the Karnak Temple Complex. We should explore the province and see if we can find a temple dedicated to Maat."
 HIG_the_christian_afterworld_title: "Zeus' Verdict"
 HIG_the_christian_afterworld_desc: "In the ancient Greek faith, the god Zeus was the king of the gods and as such he was also the Celestial Judge above everyone. While his style of judging is rather... radical, his way of dealing the punishment ensured that his word was law.\nAccording to legends of the Outworld, there is still a hidden temple dedicated to him in Athens. We should send an exploration force to Athens and see if we can harness his thunder.\nAlso, our supervisor Hecatia would love to be back in Greece again..."
 HIG_gather_the_10_kings_title: "Find the Ten Kings"
 HIG_gather_the_10_kings_desc: "The Ten Kings of Hell were the bureaucratic rulers of hells and are the superior judges of the souls. Due to economical misconduct, the Ten Kings were eventually forced to pawn their territory and the Ministry of Right and Wrong to Hecatia. Ever since they stayed in China and continued as usual, though they are now only judging the souls of the Celestial Empire. It is time to track these petty kings and re-integrate them into the Ministry."
 HIG_yama_influence_in_south_east_asia_title: "The Temples of Java"
 HIG_yama_influence_in_south_east_asia_desc: "The island Java houses great temples for both the Buddhistic and the Hinduistic faith. Religion itself is not really a matter of the yama, but Buddhism and Hinduism are special: both faiths played a key role in the origin of the first Japenese jizo, and later the first yama. In order to improve ourselves, we need to understand our origins and the virtues and sins of the religions of our ancestors.\nThe province [2690.GetName] houses two of the most impressive temples of each of the religions. We should take permanent control over it and study the temples."
 HIG_the_concept_of_dharma_title: "The Concept of Dharma"
 HIG_the_concept_of_dharma_desc: "According to the inscriptions in the temples of [2090.GetName], the high judges have their origin in the Dharmic faiths of India. The Yama, also translated as \"the King\", was the Deity of Death and judged the souls of deceased. Of course there are differences between the Japenese-Gensokyan yama and the Indian yama, but the core is the same.\nIt would be wise to study the Hindu faith for our benefit."

 ###HIGAN EVENTS###
 flavor_hig.1.t: "The many Privileges of the Shinigami"
 flavor_hig.1.desc: "The shinigami are the collectors and guides of souls. It is their duty to ferry the souls of the deceased over the Sanzu River so they can be judged for their afterlife. The tributes, which the souls carry with them, are the main source of power. In a way, the shinigami are responsible for the economical growth of [Root.GetName].\nHowever, their leader, Komachi Onozuka, has a tendency to slack with her job. A lot. While she is a person of a nice heart, her behavior is irresponsible. Komachi managed to gain privileges from Hecatia, which allow the shinigami to be as lazy as they desire. As long these privileges are in effect there is little hope to get the shinigami back to fulfil their duty."
 flavor_hig.1.a: "Komachi needs more scolding in the future..."
 flavor_hig.2.t: "Resolvent of the Religious Chaos"
 flavor_hig.2.desc: "Religion in Gensokyo has been a controversial matter ever since the first Hakurei Shinto schism. Reimu, Sanae, Meira, Byakuren and Miko tried to enforce their vision on Gensokyo. They fought countless battles for a religious war they never won.\nIn the end, however, all these great religious figures have lost their followership and their political power. As such, the matter of a spread of any of these religions has become obsolete to the great Yamaxanadu."
 flavor_hig.2.a: "Sometimes the winning move is not to play at all."
 flavor_hig.3.t: "Judge and Jury"
 flavor_hig.3.desc: "Former Hell is once again part of [Root.GetName], but its population are a heavy burden to govern for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] - and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows it. Fortunately for us, the former ruler, Satori Komeiji, is offering us a solution: we legitimize Satori Komeiji as the undisputed ruler of Former Hell and Chireiden. Additionally, Satori requests a position as lay judge for petty souls, as well as the jury for the grant trials in the Yama Courtroom.\nIn return Satori pledges absolute loyalty to the crown of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and ensures her support in all battles ahead."
 flavor_hig.3.a: "Intriguing. You shall have your legitimation, Exarch Satori."
 flavor_hig.3.b: "Thanks for the offer, but I have to decline."
 flavor_hig.4.t: "The Religious Head of Gensokyo"
 flavor_hig.4.desc: "Gensokyo is split in five major beliefs: the orthodox Hakurei Tradition, which still clings to the era before the spellcard rules; the classic Hakurei Shintoism which is about worshipping the different deities of Gensokyo; the heretic Moriya Shintoism, which is purely focused on the two goddesses and their shrine maiden in the Moriya Lands; the utopic Touhou Buddhism, which is based on the idea of equality between humans and youkai, and the foreign Touhou Taoism, which brings a lot of concepts of magic to Gensokyo.\n\nAll five religions try to overthrow the other ones and to establish themselves as the \"State Religion of Gensokyo\". Their respective leaders are trying to convince the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that they should get the official legitimation for their belief."
 flavor_hig.4.a: "Hakurei Shintoism is the only true faith in Gensokyo."
 flavor_hig.4.b: "Moriya Shintoism is the future of Gensokyo."
 flavor_hig.4.c: "The Hakurei Traditions have always been the true faith, and they shall it be again."

They designed the laws and rules which are the benchmarks for judging the souls.\nIn recent time the Ministry has shown financial problems left and right. Eventurally, the 10 Kings - the rulers of the Ministry - pawned Higan and their other territories in Gensokyo to Hecatia. Ever since their influence over the yama has been more and more diminishing, and as a result the rules for the yama have become quite dated.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] made the bold decision to found a new Ministry of Right and Wrong, which is specialized for the cases of Gensokyo.

But one trait of hers played against her in the long last: her hubris.\nAlthough Yukari always avoided a direct confrontation with the great Yamaxanadu Eiki Shiki, she made the arrogant mistake to think that the yamas have no military experience whatsoever, and underestimated our tactical maneuvers.\nIn the end, Mayohiga has been defeated.

But the Yamaxanadu is dealing with two very unusual persons anyway.\nMokou Fujiwara sues Kaguya Houraisan for bringing dishonor upon her family as well as cursing her with immortality which she never wanted to begin with. Meanwhile, Kaguya accuses Mokou of scamming as Mokou's family promised to deliver the Five Impossible Requests, yet not only have failed this task but also send their daughter Mokou to assassinate Kaguya.\n\nObviously, both immortals are telling a warped and biased version of the same story. Neither of them realize though, that the trial is not about their doings in Japan but about their crime against shinigami work laws...\n\"Order! Order!

After several hours of venturing the ancient catacombs and solving countless puzzles, [Root.Monarch.GetName] reached a grand throne room with a statue sitting in front of a judge's desk. The papers on the desk showcase a map of India. The throne itself had a writing - \"Here rests the Yama-raja, once one of the great kings who surpassed mortal lifehood. May his shell rest while his spirit judge the dead.\"\nAfter inspecting the inscriptions next to the throne, it seems it is possible to resurrect him, though it would require a harsh strike with the Rod of Remorse to bring him back to life..."

The Kashi Vishwanath Temple and the Sun Temple are both magnificent places of worship dedicated to more Hindu deities. Unlike the Prambanan Temple, these sites are actually actively maintained and even hold more information regarding our origins.\n\nApparently, the first of our kind, Yama-raja, and his twin sister Yami were the children of the Sun God Surya and the Dusk Goddess Sanjna. While his sister Yami represented life, the good king Yama represented death and, after his own death, justice as he became the very first of those who judge the deceased.\n\nThrough the influence of the Hindustic faith, the Buddhistic faith picked the deity of the Yama up for its own belief system, which then later evolved in China and Japan to the yama we know today. In a sense, our kind is one of Hindustic deities and as such it is now clear that the temples of the Dharmic religions are our birth right."

At first it seemed to be completely buried underneath sand, but thanks to the endless efort of the team, the temples were able to be excavated.\nWithin the complex, [Root.Monarch.GetName] found a section dedicated to Maat, which describes the way of judgement of a soul. She takes the heart of the soul and places it on a scale. On the other side of the scale there is a single feather, representing all the good deeds. If the scale tips in favor the feather then the soul shall pass to the paradise."

Even the goddesses of Gensokyo heard of (and even made experiences with) Zeus, the legendary king of gods of the ancient Greek faith. Our exploration team discovered an ancient Zeus temple in Athen and found the scripts regarding his style of judgement. Apparently, the god was rather arbitrary in his ruling style, and his activities in his free time are... deviant to say the least.\nBut good thing comes out of this tour at least: Hecatia has been enjoying her journey, and even found a way to commune with the ancient Greek gods. In a twist of fate, Hecatia gained the lightning of Zeus, which she now gifts to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
