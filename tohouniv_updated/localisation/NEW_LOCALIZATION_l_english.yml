 th_estate_yama_reform_the_judicative_desc: "The judgement of the souls is a complicated matter, and not all judges are equally well equipped as the Yamaxanadu herself to handle these trials.

 th_estate_yama_centralize_gensokyan_authority_desc: "Many laws in Gensokyo will be enforced on a provincial level.

Due to the bureaucratic issues, Eiki Shiki, Supreme Judge of Gensokyo, then decided split Higan into two regions: Hell and Former Hell.\nWhile Higan was ruled by Eiki, Former Hell was under direct control of Hecatia. But the goddess preferred to have somebody else doing her work, and so she decided to drop the claim entirely, turning Former Hell into a battle field between the satoris, the onis and the spirits.\n\nEventually, Satori Komeiji seized power over Former Hell and became its absolute ruler.

Fortunately, there are shrine maidens and religious heads, who resolve these incidents as fast as possible - most notably Reimu Hakurei.\nHowever, incidents are only one issue. The other is the utter religious chaos reigning in Gensokyo. We will have to side with one of the great religions if we want to bring unity to the continent."
 HIG_remove_tenshi_from_heaven_title: "Remove Tenshi from Power"
 HIG_remove_tenshi_from_heaven_desc: "While it is our duty to govern Hell, the celestials inhabit Heaven and ensure its stabilty and well being.

Her selfish and irresponsible nature is not only a liability to Heaven, but also a threat to Gensokyo as a whol!\nAlthough it is not the yama way to fiddle with the high heavens, it is still our duty as peacekeeper of Gensokyo to remove the threat Tenshi represents."

For the most part, the Animal Realm has been reigned by three \"gangs\" which are ruling by the rule of the strongest.\nThe great Yamaxanadu has rarely reason to meddle with the strife of the Matriarchs. However, when when word reached Eiki that the gang leaders are enslaving the human spirits in order to create an army, as well as the involvement of a goddess to subdue the gang leaders, it became clear to our realm that Animal Realm needs to be governed by the yama instead of these animals."

 flavor_hig.1.t: "The many Privileges of the Shinigami"
 flavor_hig.1.desc: "The shinigami are the collectors and guides of souls. It is their duty to ferry the souls of the deceased over the Sanzu River so they can be judged for their afterlife. The tributes, which the souls carry with them, are the main source of power. In a way, the shinigami are responsible for the economical growth of [Root.GetName].\nHowever, their leader, Komachi Onozuka, has a tendency to slack with her job. A lot. While she is a person of a nice heart, her behavior is irresponsible. Komachi managed to gain privileges from Hecatia, which allow the shinigami to be as lazy as they desire. As long these privileges are in effect there is little hope to get the shinigami back to fulfil their duty."
 flavor_hig.1.a: "Komachi needs more scolding in the future..."
 flavor_hig.2.t: "Resolvement of the Religious Chaos"
 flavor_hig.2.desc: "Religion in Gensokyo has been a controvertial matter ever since the first Hakurei Shinto schism.

Fortunately for us, the former ruler, Satori Komeiji, is offering us a solution: we legitimize Satori Komeiji as the undisputed ruler of Former Hell and Chireiden. Additionally, Satori requests a position as lay judge for petty souls, as well as the jury for the grant trials in the Yama Courtroom.\nIn return Satori pledges absolute loyalty to the crown of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and ensures her support in all battles ahead."
 flavor_hig.3.a: "Intriguing. You shall have your legitimation, Exarch Satori."
 flavor_hig.3.b: "Thanks for the offer, but I have to decline."
 flavor_hig.4.t: "The Religious Head of Gensokyo"
 flavor_hig.4.desc: "Gensokyo is split in five majore beliefs: the orthodox Hakurei Tradition, which still clinges to the era before the spellcard rules; the classic Hakurei Shintoism which is about worshipping the different deities of Gensokyo; the heretic Moriya Shintoism, which is purely focused on the two goddesses and their shrine maiden in the Moriya Lands; the utopic Touhou Buddhism, which is based on the idea of equality between humans and youkai, and the foreign Touhou Taoism, which brings a lot of concepts of magic to Gensokyo.\n\nAll five religions try to overthrow the other ones and to establish themselves as the \"State Religion of Gensokyo\". Their respective leaders are trying to convince the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that they should get the official legitimation for their belief."

 flavor_hig.5.desc: "Our realm is not one, which seeks war for the most part. But when we have to go to war, we strike with all of our power. Today, the almighty celestials experienced it first hand during the finale of the Siege of the Dragon Palace. Although the oni forces tried to minimize casualties on both sides, the reckless leader, Tenshi Hinanawi, lead her people in suicide attacks against our forces completely irelevant to the siege.\nAt long last, Tenshi and the Dragon Palace had to surrender to our forces, and awaits now her fate."

Although all three have formidable power and influence, all three fear the immense authority Eiki Shiki radiates.\nAll three matriarchs stand trial for disturbing the stability of hell, unnecessary cruelty which goes way beyond what is seen as necessary and for their threat to the safety of Gensokyo as a whole.\nAll three present their case and their defense, but in the end they have to oblige to Eiki's judgement: \"I hereby declare all of you as guilty...\""

 flavor_hig.7.t: "Kutaka's New Role"
 flavor_hig.7.desc: "Kutaka Niwatari has been a subject to the Yamaxanadu for decades. Her role was to guarding the gate between hell, the real world and the Animal Realm as the gang leaders have been very aggressive and were a threat to everyone who visits Hell.\nWhen the Animal Realm has become part of [Root.GetName], Kutaka's role has become redundant. Due to this circumstance the suggestion has been raised to transform [GGS.GetName] to our vassal."
