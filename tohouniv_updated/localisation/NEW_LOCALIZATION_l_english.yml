 th_estate_yama_establish_lecturing_desc: "The highest of the Yama, Eiki Shiki, travels through Gensokyo in her free time to lecture the sinners, and notify them to take a better path if they want to avoid hell.\nBy establishing official lecturing measures, we can institutionalize these measures and use lecturing methods to excommunicate entire states should they behave like insane warmonger."
 th_estate_yama_regulate_conquest: "Regulate Conquests"
 th_estate_yama_regulate_conquest_desc: "Gensokyo is supposed to be a paradise for the people, who cannot live in the outworld. However, the continent is hearing the drums of war. Youkais, humans, even the fairies are mustering their troops for battles and conquests.\nWhile our influence is not strong enough yet to forbid these foolish acts, we can at least use our judicative authority to regulate the rate of conquest in Gensokyo."
 th_estate_yama_enforce_peace: "Gensokyan Peace Enforcement"
 th_estate_yama_enforce_peace_desc: "Some eccentric rulers claim that war is an extension of diplomacy. It can be true in less civilized regions, here in Gensokyo war shall never have a reason to exist.\nBy implementing special laws in Gensokyo, we can gain the ability to enforce peace upon the ambitious warmongers of Gensokyo."
 th_estate_yama_internal_higan_reform: "Establish Trial Committee"
 th_estate_yama_internal_higan_reform_desc: "Our realm is not only a place within hell, where the guilty shall suffer. It is also the largest state of the yama - the judges of the dead. These yama work as the extension of the will of the 10 Kings, those who judge the souls of humankind.\nDue to the growth of humanity, the number of souls to judge has increased excessively. By establishing a trial committee we can organize the judges every yama has to do per day much better."
 th_estate_yama_gensokyan_edict: "Enact Gensokyan Edict"
 th_estate_yama_gensokyan_edict_desc: "The first edict of the Yama Realm. It contains all the direct powers and responsibility of the yama, as well as the huge book of laws which are applied for Gensokyo. With this edict, the foundation for a unified, law abiding Gensokyo has been laid."
 th_estate_yama_appoint_executor: "Appoint Executor Law"
 th_estate_yama_appoint_executor_desc: "Even the best yama cannot be everywhere to lecture the sinners. Because of that it has become a necessity for the Yama Realm to appoint a non-yama as their official Executor, who obeys the orders of the High Judge."
 th_estate_yama_reform_the_judicative: "Reform the Judicative"
 th_estate_yama_reform_the_judicative_desc: "The judgement of the souls is a complicated matter, and not all judges are equally well equipped as the Yamaxanadu herself to handle these trials.

 th_estate_yama_establish_laws_of_war: "Enact Laws of War"
 th_estate_yama_establish_laws_of_war_desc: "Even the most beloved peacekeeper needs to prepare for war. By enacting the Laws of War, the Ministry of Right and Wrong gains the right to establish a private standing army of yama, who serve as law enforcers of the [Root.GetAdjective] state."

 th_estate_yama_centralize_gensokyan_authority: "Centralize Law Judgements and Law Enforcements"
 th_estate_yama_centralize_gensokyan_authority_desc: "Many laws in Gensokyo will be enforced on a provincial level. In theory, it is an excellent system to keep sins low and the enforcement rate of laws high. In practice, the Gensokyan have proven to be corruptible. They bend the laws to their own benefit and commit sins on their own.\nBy centralizing the judgements and the enforcement of the laws, we can ensure less sinners finding their way to the Grand Court and assert the Yama Authority in Gensokyo."
 th_estate_yama_expand_roles: "Enact Law of Representation"
 th_estate_yama_expand_roles_desc: "Gensokyo's society is split in the three categories: the commoner humans, the wild youkais and the dutiful shrine maidens. By enacting the law of representation, each of these estates would be able to cast their vote for the reforms enacted by the high Yamaxanadu."
 th_estate_yama_sphere_of_influence: "Enact Absolute Authority Edict"
 th_estate_yama_sphere_of_influence_desc: "The third edict of the Yama Realm.

 th_estate_yama_eternal_peace: "Eternal Peace"
 th_estate_yama_eternal_peace_desc: "Through several reforms and edicts, the people of Gensokyo have finally started to listen to the great Yamaxanadu.

 ###MISSIONS FOR HIG###
 HIG_recruit_oni_strike_force_title: "Recruit the Oni Army"
 HIG_recruit_oni_strike_force_desc: "Ever since their loss of the Youkai Mountain, the oni have become residents of Hell and Former Hell. While the oni in Hell are designated to torture the damned, they also have a duty as the army of [Root.GetName]. We should either contact the local kishin to rally the oni, or get in touch with the Oni Exiles to get either support."
 hig_disable_all_previous_reforms_tt: "Convert all §YImperial Yama Privileges§! into a single one §YReform§!."
 HIG_reorganize_the_shinigami_title: "Reorganize the Shinigami"
 HIG_reorganize_the_shinigami_desc: "The shinigami are responsible for ferrying the souls to Higan in order for them to be judged. In theory that is.\nDue to the many privileges Komachi managed to get from Hecatia for the shinigami, the influx of new souls has come to a near standstill. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] respects free days and vacations, but their behavior is endangering the whole flow of the afterlife. We need to revoke their privileges!"
 HIG_deal_with_komachis_slack_title: "Revoke the Slacking"
 HIG_deal_with_komachis_slack_desc: "After ensuring the accountability of the shinigami, it is time now for revoking the last privilege, which allows the shinigami to slack from their work."
 HIG_improve_hells_infrastructure_title: "Improve Hell's Infrastructure"
 HIG_improve_hells_infrastructure_desc: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not only the highest judge of the dead, but also the vice ruler of Hell. As such, it is our utter most priority to maintain and improve the infrastructure in Hell in order for keeping the sinners locked up and punished.\nBoth can be achieved relatively simple by constructing workshops, which serve as the prison cells for the damned, as well as their eternal torture as workforces."
 TH_LOW_AUTONOMY_HELL_WORKSHOPS: "workshops with less than 5 autonomy"
 hig_can_use_komachi_tt: "Allow the recruitment of §YKomachi§! as either advisor or general via a decision."
 HIG_take_over_chireiden_title: "Take over Former Hell"
 HIG_take_over_chireiden_desc: "Former Hell was once our realm of operation. But due to the sheer overpopulation of evil spirits, demons and other creatures of the underworld, Higan needed to expand. Due to the bureaucratic issues, Eiki Shiki, Supreme Judge of Gensokyo, then decided to split Higan into two regions: Hell and Former Hell.\nWhile Higan was ruled by Eiki, Former Hell was under direct control of Hecatia. But the goddess preferred to have somebody else doing her work, and so she decided to drop the claim entirely, turning Former Hell into a battlefield between the satoris, the onis and the spirits.\n\nEventually, Satori Komeiji seized power over Former Hell and became its absolute ruler. Despite all these events, Former Hell still is sovereign territory of [Root.GetName]. We should remind Satori about that."
 HIG_take_over_chireiden_tt: "An event will fire if this mission gets completed through §YDiplomacy§! or through §YWar§! with §Y[CRD.GetName]§!."
 HIG_side_with_a_shrine_maiden_title: "Appoint Religious Head"
 HIG_side_with_a_shrine_maiden_desc: "Gensokyo is the target of many antagonistic forces, who try to to tip the balance of power to their favor by all means. These beings cause continental incidents, which bring only chaos and discord to the mortals and youkai alike. Fortunately, there are shrine maidens and religious heads, who resolve these incidents as fast as possible - most notably Reimu Hakurei.\nHowever, incidents are only one issue. The other is the utter religious chaos reigning in Gensokyo. We will have to side with one of the great religions if we want to bring unity to the continent."
 HIG_remove_tenshi_from_heaven_title: "Remove Tenshi from Power"
 HIG_remove_tenshi_from_heaven_desc: "While it is our duty to govern Hell, the celestials inhabit Heaven and ensure its stability and well being. Usually, the yama don't interfere with the business of the celestials, but for reasons unknown to us, Tenshi Hinanawi has become the leader of Heavenly Realm. Her selfish and irresponsible nature is not only a liability to Heaven, but also a threat to Gensokyo as a whol!\nAlthough it is not the yama way to fiddle with the high heavens, it is still our duty as peacekeeper of Gensokyo to remove the threat Tenshi represents."
 HIG_remove_tenshi_from_heaven_tt: "§Y[HVR.Capital.GetName]§! is controlled by §Y[Root.GetName]§! or its §YAllies§! or §YSubjects§!."
 HIG_enact_the_first_reform_tier_title: "Enact First Yama Edict"
 HIG_enact_the_first_reform_tier_desc: "The first edict of the Yama Realm. It contains all the direct powers and responsibility of the yama, as well as the huge book of laws which are applied for Gensokyo. With this edict, the foundation for a unified, law abiding Gensokyo has been laid.""
 HIG_enact_the_second_reform_tier_title: "Enact Second Yama Edict"
 HIG_enact_the_second_reform_tier_desc: "The second edict of the Yama Realm. It contains the laws for the appointment of executors, reformations of the judicative and the [Root.GetAdjective] right to specialize yama into law enforcers - all for the purpose of protecting Gensokyo from foreign forces.""
 HIG_enact_the_third_reform_tier_title: "Enact Third Yama Edict"
 HIG_enact_the_third_reform_tier_desc: "The third edict of the Yama Realm. It contains the laws of centralizations of the judgements and law enforcements, as well as the laws of representation for the non-yama in the high court. It also contains the right of Yama Realm to have open borders with all Gensokyan countries.""
 HIG_enact_the_last_reform_tier_title: "Enact Last Yama Edict"
 HIG_enact_the_last_reform_tier_desc: "The fourth and final edict of the Yama Realm. It contains all the laws and reforms to ensure a stable and united Gensokyo."
 HIG_handle_the_gang_wars_title: "Handle the Gang Wars"
 HIG_handle_the_gang_wars_desc: "The eastern part of Hell is the well known Animal Realm, which is inhabited by the spirits of the deceased animals. For the most part, the Animal Realm has been ruled by three \"gangs\" which are ruled by the strongest.\nThe great Yamaxanadu has rarely reason to meddle with the strife of the Matriarchs. However, when when word reached Eiki that the gang leaders are enslaving the human spirits in order to create an army, as well as the involvement of a goddess to subdue the gang leaders, it became clear to our realm that Animal Realm needs to be governed by the yama instead of these animals."
 HIG_stablize_the_animal_realms_title: "Stabilize the Animal Realm"
 HIG_stablize_the_animal_realms_desc: "The Animal Realm in the east has been in constant distress due to the gang wars. Now that we control most of these lands, it is time to repair the damage these matriarchs have done to Hell."
 HIG_show_yukaris_place_title: "Scold the Gap Youkai"
 HIG_show_yukaris_place_desc: "The gap youkai Yukari Yakumo has always been a thorn in the side to the Ministry of Right and Wrong. Admittedly, she and the other two sages are responsible for the creation of Gensokyo in the first place, but neither of them saw it as necessary to regulate youkai society nor to enforce the laws these very sages have created in the first place.\nIt is time to teach humility and responsibility to the gap youkai."
 HIG_resolve_the_immortal_conflict_title: "The Immortal Rivals"
 HIG_resolve_the_immortal_conflict_desc: "Death is the fate of all living beings and a crucial part of the balance of the universe. Yet there are two rivals who defy the peace of death itself. Kaguya and Mokou are these mentioned immortal rivals, who kill each other on a daily basis. Due to their immortal status, there is no reason to lecture them in the first place - after all they will never reach the Grand Courtroom in the first place.\nThere is one issue though: their constant deaths irritate the shinigami of Higan. Whenever either of them gets slain, the shinigami get a notification through their senses, which results in their departure to obtain the new soul. When they reach the \"corpse\", however, they find a living, breathing immortal instead, wasting the shinigami's time. We have to end their daily brawls once and for all."
 HIG_hire_yama_advisors_title: "Advisors for the Court"
 HIG_hire_yama_advisors_desc: "Although the Yamaxanadu is the ruler of hell, the position's role is first and foremost to judge the deceased. Because of that, our realm always needs at least one or two competent advisors to ensure the stability of hell."
 HIG_take_over_the_road_of_liminality_title: "Connect the Road"
 HIG_take_over_the_road_of_liminality_desc: "The Road of Liminality is the crossroad between Gensokyo and Hell. As such, many spirits and ghosts as well as living beings pass this road. Eventually, the road has become a hub of trade between the living and the dead.\nBut not all merchants are coming to this place in good faith. We should seize control over this road and ensure that the scamming ghosts are sent back to hell."
 HIG_move_the_ministry_to_gensokyo_title: "Create a new Ministry"
 HIG_move_the_ministry_to_gensokyo_desc: "The Ministry of Right and Wrong is the political institution which is responsible for the government and administration of all dimensions of hell. It's also the organization, which creates the laws and rules which are used to judge a soul. The yama are direct subordinates of this ministry and our actions are the will of the 10 Kings of the Ministry.\nBut their influence was not meant to be forever. The 10 Kings are exceptional judges, but their economic judgement is severely lacking. Eventually, the kings pawned Higan and their other territories in Gensokyo to Hecatia. It is clear that the once mighty Ministry of Right and Wrong is a shell of what it once was. It is time to establish our Ministry!"
 HIG_take_control_over_netherworld_title: "The Spirit Princess"
 HIG_take_control_over_netherworld_desc: "The realms of the after life are split into three major regions: Heaven for those who lived a content and compassionate life; Hell for the sinners who lived a malicious life at the cost of others; and Netherworld for the guiltless who desire to achieve nirvana or to be reincarnated.\nThe mistress of Netherworld is Yuyuko Saigyouji, a subordinate of the great Yamaxanadu - though this relationship is very much one sided. While we provide the Netherworld resources and protection, all the Spirit Princess did was threaten the balance of Gensokyo. It is time to remind Yuyuko that she still is a subject to the Yama Authority."
 hig_has_return_hecatia_war_cb_flag_tt: "Enables a casus belli against §Y[HEC.GetName]§!."
 HIG_hecatia_and_eiki_title: "Return Hecatia to Higan"
 HIG_hecatia_and_eiki_desc: "Hecatia Lapislazuli - an eccentric goddess, de jure ruler of all Hells and one of the old deities from the Outworld. While she is technically the authority above the great Yamaxanadu, Hecatia prefers to spend her time to be the advisor of the Yamaxanadu instead.\nHowever, she has been on vacations, and has been seen lastly on the moon, where she helps a being of pure rage and fury to eradicate the lunarians. These vacations have now been going for literal decades, and there seems to be no sign of her returning to Higan. The time has come for Hecatia to finally return to Higan and retake her role as an important advisor of Hell."
 HIG_hecatia_and_eiki_tt: "§Y[HEC.GetName]§! (or the owner of §Y[5324.GetName]§! if [HEC.GetName] does not exist) has lost a war against [Root.GetName] and was subject to the '§YReturn from Vacations§!' peace treaty."
 HIG_empire_of_higan_title: "Imperial Judiciary"
 HIG_empire_of_higan_desc: "Gensokyo is in need of a strong judiciary power which can enforce the law and protect its residents. It is our destiny to become such a judiciary and even surpass it in order to maintain the balance in Gensokyo."
 HIG_greatest_of_the_yama_title: "Empire of Fantasy"
 HIG_greatest_of_the_yama_desc: "The Land of Fantasy had been in inner turmoil ever since the great Hakurei Barrier fell. But this is no more. From this day forward, Gensokyo shall be ruled by the just yet gentle fist of the yama!"
 HIG_greatest_of_the_yama_ct: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! will gain §G25.00§! power projection. This power projection is §Ypermanent§!."
 HIG_improve_the_sanzu_river_income_title: "Sanzu's Riverbanks"
 HIG_improve_the_sanzu_river_income_desc: "The Sanzu River is the mist-shrouded river that dead souls must cross in order to reach Higan, where they will await judgment. While only the dead can cross the river itself, the riverbank is a major attraction point for youkai, humans, living and undead alike.\nWe should develop the infrastructure of the riverbanks and establish a fort for the shinigami in order to protect the travellers on this place."
 HIG_establish_hig_fleet_title: "Fleet of the Judicator"
 HIG_establish_hig_fleet_desc: "Gensokyo has been separated from the Outworld ever since the creation of the Hakurei Barrier. This brought peace within the continent while also protecting it from the humans who were all too eager to set foot on Gensokyo. But as luck would have it, the barrier cracked and broke. Not only did this break the fragile peace within Gensokyo but it also made the Outworld aware of our existence. We should construct a fleet in order to protect our home from invaders."
 HIG_beyond_the_barrier_title: "Beyond the Barrier"
 HIG_beyond_the_barrier_desc: "Although our priority lies in the protection of Gensokyo, the Outworld still contains mysteries which are too compelling to us to be ignored. We should send a small fleet to discover what lies behind the remains of the Hakurei Barrier, and explore the wonders of the world."
 HIG_the_jizo_of_japan_title: "The Jizo of Japan"
 HIG_the_jizo_of_japan_desc: "All great Yamaxanadus used to be jizo statues, which gained enough faith to become sentient. These jizos then got selected by the Ten Kings in order to become the yama we know today.\nDue to the financial bankruptcy of the former Ten Kings, the Ministry of Right and Wrong fell in Hecatia's care. As a result, there has been a lack of new yamas to cover the exponential growth of the souls which need judgement. Hecatia promised to take care of it, but her eccentric nature makes her quite unreliable. It would be wise if we take matters in our own hands and get access to the greatest source of new jizos in Japan."
 HIG_the_way_of_buddhism_title: "The Way of Buddhism"
 HIG_the_way_of_buddhism_desc: "Many aspects of Gensokyan culture and religion have their roots in Buddhism. Many of the laws and rules we have to use for our judgements are based on Buddhist virtues. We should get into contact with the important religious centers for each of the Buddhistic branches."
 HIG_discover_the_middle_east_title: "Push Westwards"
 HIG_discover_the_middle_east_desc: "Our superior, Hecatia, is not native to Gensokyo but comes from the far west. Of course our uttermost priority still lies in Gensokyo, but there is a certain curiosity to her origins. We should dispatch a small fleet to discover the homeland of the goddess of Hell."
 HIG_discover_the_middle_east_tt: "Allow the one time purchase of the island §Y[1099.GetName]§! through a decision."
 HIG_discover_europe_title: "Discover Europe"
 HIG_discover_europe_desc: "The eternal deserts are - with the exception of a few settlements and the one or another oasis - completely devoid of life. All that we were able to find was sand and the one or another tomb.\nHowever, it seems we are getting close as the local humans mentioned \"Greeks\", which are the supposed people Hecatia once served for. We have to traverse the desert and push even further west."
 HIG_lecture_the_bad_title: "Lecture the Evil"
 HIG_lecture_the_bad_desc: "The rulers of the different realms of Gensokyo are ambitious. This in itself is not a problem, but their behavior, which is a result of their ambitions, is problematic for the balance of Gensokyo. We have to lecture those who do bad, and grant grace to those who will bring justice."
 HIG_appoint_competent_executor_title: "The Astral Executor"
 HIG_appoint_competent_executor_desc: "Long before the creation of Former Hell, the Ten Kings held territory in Gensokyo which is today known as \"Old Hell\". As it was a time long before the first Yamaxanadu, there is not much known about this area nor when the switch from Old Hell to Former Hell happened. For all we know is that Old Hell is now owned by an ancient protector of Hell: the Astral Knight Konngara.\nIt just happens to be that we are looking for an Executor who shall embody the long Arm of Justice. Konngara would be an excellent choice for this role."
 HIG_appoint_competent_executor_tt: "§Y[KNN.GetName]§! gets the modifier '§YMilitary Administration§!' if they are the subject type '§YExecutor of the Yama§!' of [Root.GetName], giving the following effects:\nDiscipline: §G+5.0%§!\nSiege Ability: §G+15.0%§!"
 HIG_peace_freedom_justice_and_security_title: "Separation of Power"
 HIG_peace_freedom_justice_and_security_desc: "We have the important task to maintain peace, freedom, justice and security in Gensokyo. However, if we truly want to achieve this goal we should ensure that no realm grows too powerful. It is easier for us to project our authority against many smaller states than a few grand nations."
 HIG_peace_freedom_justice_and_security_tt: "At least §Y30§! countries exist in Gensokyo (§Y[1.th_gensokyan_counter.GetValue]§!/§Y30§!)."
 HIG_peace_freedom_justice_and_security_ct: "Every §YGensokyan§! country's opinion of §Y[Root.GetName]§! improves by §G75§!."
 HIG_afterlive_of_the_deserts_title: "Desert's Rites"
 HIG_afterlive_of_the_deserts_desc: "Long before the Islam emerged in the Middle East, the ancient Kingdom of Egypt worshipped many more than one god. In their pantheon there is one goddess in particular who strikes similarities in our kind: the ancient goddess Maat. Unfortunately, the Roman and later the Muslim conquest of the Middle East ensured the destruction of all the writings about the ancient Egyptian deities. But not all is lost! In the obscure place of [360.GetName] there is the Karnak Temple Complex. We should explore the province and see if we can find a temple dedicated to Maat."
 HIG_the_christian_afterworld_title: "Zeus' Verdict"
 HIG_the_christian_afterworld_desc: "In the ancient Greek faith, the god Zeus was the king of the gods and as such he was also the Celestial Judge above everyone. While his style of judging is rather... radical, his way of dealing the punishment ensured that his word was law.\nAccording to legends of the Outworld, there is still a hidden temple dedicated to him in Athens. We should send an exploration force to Athens and see if we can harness his thunder.\nAlso, our supervisor Hecatia would love to be back in Greece again..."
 HIG_gather_the_10_kings_title: "Find the Ten Kings"
 HIG_gather_the_10_kings_desc: "The Ten Kings of Hell were the bureaucratic rulers of hell and are the superior judges of the souls. Due to economical misconduct, the Ten Kings were eventually forced to pawn their territory and the Ministry of Right and Wrong to Hecatia. They stayed in China and continued on as usual, though they are now only judging the souls of the Celestial Empire. It is time to track these petty kings and re-integrate them into the Ministry."
 HIG_yama_influence_in_south_east_asia_title: "The Temples of Java"
 HIG_yama_influence_in_south_east_asia_desc: "The island of Java houses great temples for both the Buddhism and the Hinduism. Religion itself is not really a matter of the yama, but Buddhism and Hinduism are special: both faiths played a key role in the origin of the first Japanese jizo, and later the first yama. In order to improve ourselves, we need to understand our origins and the virtues and sins of the religions of our ancestors.\nThe province [2690.GetName] houses two of the most impressive temples of each of the religions. We should take permanent control over it and study the temples."
 HIG_the_concept_of_dharma_title: "The Concept of Dharma"
 HIG_the_concept_of_dharma_desc: "According to the inscriptions in the temples of [2090.GetName], the high judges have their origin in the Dharmic faiths of India. The Yama, also translated as \"the King\", was the Deity of Death and judged the souls of the deceased. Of course there are differences between the Japanese-Gensokyan yama and the Indian yama, but the core is the same.\nIt would be wise to study the Hindu faith for our benefit."
 HIG_land_of_the_dead_title: "The Gate of the Dead"
 HIG_land_of_the_dead_desc: "The Land and the Gate of the Dead has always been the border between Hell and Former Hell. The current holder of these lands is a tributary state of the Crown of the Yamaxanadu, but its days are numbered. It is time to change their tributary treaty, and make them a proper vassal."

 ###HIGAN EVENTS###
 flavor_hig.1.t: "The many Privileges of the Shinigami"
 flavor_hig.1.desc: "The shinigami are the collectors and guides of souls. It is their duty to ferry the souls of the deceased over the Sanzu River so they can be judged for their afterlife. The tributes, which the souls carry with them, are the main source of power. In a way, the shinigami are responsible for the economical growth of [Root.GetName].\nHowever, their leader, Komachi Onozuka, has a tendency to slack off with her job. A lot. While she is a kind hearted individual, her behavior is irresponsible. Komachi managed to gain privileges from Hecatia, which allowed the shinigami to be as lazy as they desire. As long these privileges are in effect there is little hope to get the shinigami back to fulfil their duty."
 flavor_hig.1.a: "Komachi needs more scolding in the future..."
 flavor_hig.2.t: "Resolvent of the Religious Chaos"
 flavor_hig.2.desc: "Religion in Gensokyo has been a controversial matter ever since the first Hakurei Shinto schism. Reimu, Sanae, Meira, Byakuren and Miko tried to enforce their vision on Gensokyo. They fought countless battles for a religious war they never won.\nIn the end, however, all these great religious figures have lost their followership and their political power. As such, the matter of a spread of any of these religions has become obsolete to the great Yamaxanadu."
 flavor_hig.2.a: "Sometimes the winning move is not to play at all."
 flavor_hig.3.t: "Judge and Jury"
 flavor_hig.3.desc: "Satori Komeiji always thought she could stand above the authority of the Yamaxanadu. But this war taught her that our might cannot be matched - not even by a cunning tactician such as the ruler of Chireiden herself. Fortunately for both sides, Satori has decided to negotiate with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]: the war shall end from this day forward, and Chireiden will recognize the Yama Authority as their liege. In return, Chireiden will serve Higan not as a mere vassal but as an Exarch State, which shall administer Former Hell in our name."
 flavor_hig.3.a: "This a favorable peace. I accept your offer, Exarch Satori."
 flavor_hig.3.b: "You were a subject once, and failed as such. This deal will not happen."
 flavor_hig.4.t: "The Religious Head of Gensokyo"
 flavor_hig.4.desc: "Gensokyo is split in five major beliefs: the orthodox Hakurei Tradition, which still clings to the era before the spellcard rules; the classic Hakurei Shintoism which is about worshipping the different deities of Gensokyo; the heretic Moriya Shintoism, which is purely focused on the two goddesses and their shrine maiden in the Moriya Lands; the utopic Touhou Buddhism, which is based on the idea of equality between humans and youkai, and the foreign Touhou Taoism, which brings a lot of concepts of magic to Gensokyo.\n\nAll five religions try to overthrow the other ones and to establish themselves as the \"State Religion of Gensokyo\". Their respective leaders are trying to convince the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that they should get the official legitimation for their belief."
 flavor_hig.4.a: "Hakurei Shintoism is the only true faith in Gensokyo."
 flavor_hig.4.a.tt: "[Root.GetName] receives §G[Root.HKR_total_dev_tt.GetValue]§! ¤ as a bribe from [HKR.Monarch.GetName]."

 flavor_hig.4.f: "The High Judge is above such matters."
 flavor_hig.5.t: "Reorganization of the High Heaven"
 flavor_hig.5.desc: "Our realm is not one, which seeks war for the most part. But when we have to go to war, we strike with all of our power. Today, the almighty celestials experienced it first hand during the finale of the Siege of the Dragon Palace. Although the oni forces tried to minimize casualties on both sides, the reckless leader, Tenshi Hinanawi, lead her people in suicide attacks against our forces completely irrelevant to the siege.\nAt long last, Tenshi and the Dragon Palace had to surrender to our forces, and awaits now her fate."
 flavor_hig.5.a: "Tenshi shall forever be under house arrest."

 flavor_hig.6.t: "Trial of the Matriarchs"
 flavor_hig.6.desc: "Three chairs stand before the grand judge. Each one for one of the three matriarchs: Yachie Kicchou, Saki Kurokoma and Yuuma Toutetsu. Although all three have formidable power and influence, all three fear the immense authority Eiki Shiki radiates.\nAll three matriarchs stand trial for disturbing the stability of hell, unnecessary cruelty which goes way beyond what is seen as necessary and for their threat to the safety of Gensokyo as a whole.\nAll three present their case and their defense, but in the end they have to oblige to Eiki's judgement: \"I hereby declare all of you as guilty...\""
 flavor_hig.6.a: "... and condemn you to house arrest for a century."
 flavor_hig.6.a.tt: "Can not use the decision '§YRecall our Ruler§!' for §Y100 years§!."
 flavor_hig.7.t: "Kutaka's New Role"
 flavor_hig.7.desc: "Kutaka Niwatari has been a subject of the Yamaxanadu for decades. Her role was to guarding the gate between hell, the real world and the Animal Realm as the gang leaders have been very aggressive and were a threat to everyone who visits Hell.\nWhen the Animal Realm has become part of [Root.GetName], Kutaka's role has become redundant. Due to this circumstance the suggestion has been raised to transform [GGS.GetName] to our vassal."
 flavor_hig.7.a: "It is time to consolidate Hell."
 flavor_hig.8.t: "The Ministry of Right and Wrong in Gensokyo"
 flavor_hig.8.desc: "The Ministry of Right and Wrong is the organization which is responsible for the influence of the yama in Gensokyo. They designed the laws and rules which are the benchmarks for judging the souls.\nIn recent time the Ministry has shown financial problems left and right. Eventually, the 10 Kings - the rulers of the Ministry - pawned Higan and their other territories in Gensokyo to Hecatia. Ever since their influence over the yama has been more and more diminishing, and as a result the rules for the yama have become quite dated.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] made the bold decision to found a new Ministry of Right and Wrong, which is specialized for the cases of Gensokyo. With that, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] also gained the right to declare Gensokyo wide degrees, which shall improve life on this continent."
 flavor_hig.8.a: "Justice shall reign in this land at last!"
 flavor_hig.9.t: "The Lecture of the Youkai of Boundaries"
 flavor_hig.9.desc: "The great youkai Yukari Yakumo was never an easy person to deal with. Always two steps ahead, Yukari seemed to be undefeatable in a fight of wit and cunning. But one trait of hers played against her in the long last: her hubris.\nAlthough Yukari always avoided a direct confrontation with the great Yamaxanadu Eiki Shiki, she made the arrogant mistake to think that the yamas have no military experience whatsoever, and underestimated our tactical maneuvers.\nIn the end, Mayohiga has been defeated. The realm has been humiliated and their mistress was finally forced to face the lectures of the Yamaxanadu."
 flavor_hig.9.a: "You don't need any lecture anymore, Yukari. The humiliation has been scolding enough."
 flavor_hig.10.t: "Trial of the Immortals"
 flavor_hig.10.desc: "It is unusual for the Yamaxanadu to judge a case of the living. Much more is it unusual that it is a trial with both a plaintiff and an accused. But the Yamaxanadu is dealing with two very unusual persons anyway.\nMokou Fujiwara sues Kaguya Houraisan for bringing dishonor upon her family as well as cursing her with immortality which she never wanted to begin with. Meanwhile, Kaguya accuses Mokou of scamming as Mokou's family promised to deliver the Five Impossible Requests, yet not only have failed this task but also send their daughter Mokou to assassinate Kaguya.\n\nObviously, both immortals are telling a warped and biased version of the same story. Neither of them realize though, that the trial is not about their doings in Japan but about their crime against shinigami work laws...\n\"Order! Order! Houraisan Kaguya, Fujiwara no Mokou; in view of the evidence presented to me I come to the following conclusion...\""
 flavor_hig.10.a: "... Kaguya is guilty. I sentence you to serve Mokou!"

 flavor_hig.11.t: "The Departing of Hecatia"
 flavor_hig.11.desc: "The conflict between our good goddess Hecatia and the yama escalated into a total war - a war which we shamefully have lost. As a result of that, Hecatia is forced to move back to Higan, completely abandoning the invasion of the moon. Now it is up to Junko and Clownpiece to rule our realm..."
 flavor_hig.11.a: "Bad times are ahead of us..."
 flavor_hig.11.tt: "Can not use the decision '§YRecall our Ruler§!' for §Y75 years§!."
 flavor_hig.12.t: "Return of the Ten Kings"
 flavor_hig.12.desc: "After an extensive search in China, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] finally managed to find and meet the Ten Kings in [2140.GetName]. The ten glorious kings judged the souls with such efficiency and bureaucratic mastery, even the high [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was impressed. Still, the kings mourned the place they once had in [Root.GetName]. The kings accepted the offer to return to Gensokyo. However, due to their shortcomings in the past, the kings were restricted to an advisor role and commitment to the judgement of the dead."
 flavor_hig.12.a: "Their time of ruling is over. Now they serve the Yama."
 flavor_hig.13.t: "The Buddhist Teachings"
 flavor_hig.13.desc: "As the judges of the dead the ruling class of [Root.GetName] are highly educated, and have the many yama laws needed for judgements memorized. With that said, there are many virtues of Buddhism, which serve as further guidance for the yama in the case they have a difficult trial at hand."
 flavor_hig.13.a: "We should implement them in our system."
 flavor_hig.13.b: "Buddhism shall become our new religion instead!"

 flavor_hig.14.desc: "While our explorer mapped out the coast of the Arabian peninsula, he discovered a rather thin settled island in the Arabian Sea. This island would be an excellent staging point for our explorers and troops if we intend to uncover the afterlife of the people of the Outworld. However, humans don't like to give away land for free. We will have to come up with an offer."

 flavor_hig.18.t: "The Ways of Confucianism and Taoism"
 flavor_hig.18.desc: "While on our search for the Ten Kings, we encountered the Confucian belief as well as the very Temple of Confucius. Next to Confucianism, the Taoists had some presence near the temple too, though not as strong. Yet still, both philosophies left a good impression on our travelling group. We should consider implementing aspects of both ways into our governing system."
 flavor_hig.18.a: "Our ruling style will benefit from both philosophies."

 flavor_hig.19.t: "The first of the Yama"
 flavor_hig.19.desc: "The ancient Prambanan Temple is one of the many Holy Sites of the Dharmic faiths. By itself, the temple seems rather unconnected to our kind. The complex of temples and shrines is dedicated to three great Hindu deities Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma. However, one of the temple buildings, which almost lies in complete ruin, had an ancient passage which led to an underground tomb established for the worship of one of the first Yamas.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] travelled to Prambanan to see the tomb for herself. After several hours of venturing the ancient catacombs and solving countless puzzles, [Root.Monarch.GetName] reached a grand throne room with a statue sitting in front of a judge's desk. The papers on the desk showcase a map of India. The throne itself had a writing - \"Here rests the Yama-raja, once one of the great kings who surpassed mortality. May his shell rest while his spirit judges the dead.\"\nAfter inspecting the inscriptions next to the throne, it seems it is possible to resurrect him, though it would require a harsh strike with the Rod of Remorse to bring him back to life..."

 flavor_hig.20.t: "The Origins of the Yama"
 flavor_hig.20.desc: "Majestic architecture splits the sky in half, and our explorers stand before it in awe. The Kashi Vishwanath Temple and the Sun Temple are both magnificent places of worship dedicated to more Hindu deities. Unlike the Prambanan Temple, these sites are actually actively maintained and even hold more information regarding our origins.\n\nApparently, the first of our kind, Yama-raja, and his twin sister Yami were the children of the Sun God Surya and the Dusk Goddess Sanjna. While his sister Yami represented life, the good king Yama represented death and, after his own death, justice as he became the very first of those who judge the deceased.\n\nThrough the influence of the Hindustic faith, Buddhism picked the deity of the Yama up for its own belief system, which then later evolved in China and Japan to the yama we know today. In a sense, our kind is one of the Hindu deities and as such it is now clear that the temples of the Dharmic religions are our birthright."
 flavor_hig.20.a: "Magnificent!"

 flavor_hig.21.desc: "The air is dry, the weather is unbearably hot and the sun seems to burn hotter than anywhere else. Despite all that, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and her exploration team reached the temple complex of Karnak. At first it seemed to be completely buried underneath sand, but thanks to the endless effort of the team, the temples were able to be excavated.\nWithin the complex, [Root.Monarch.GetName] found a section dedicated to Osiris and Anubis, which describes the way of judgement of a soul. They take the heart of the soul and place it on a scale. On the other side of the scale there is a single feather, representing all the good deeds. If the scale tips in favor of the feather then the soul shall pass to paradise."
 flavor_hig.21.a: "A feather? That's a cheaper way than I thought."
 flavor_hig.22.t: "The Senate of the Underworld"
 flavor_hig.22.desc: "There is no god from Europe as famous as Zeus. Even the goddesses of Gensokyo heard of (and even made experiences with) Zeus, the legendary king of gods of the ancient Greek faith. Our exploration team discovered an ancient temple in Athens and found some scripts regarding Hades, the god of the Underworld. Apparently, the god had a council of three ancient Greek kings who decided the fate of souls.\nIn addition to the process of judging souls, there was another surprise benefit: Hecatia has been enjoying her journey, and even found a way to commune with the ancient Greek gods. In a twist of fate, Hecatia gained the method to create helmets that make the user invisible, which she now gives to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

Meanwhile, Former Hell was the battlefield of different factions who aimed for dominance in the region. Eventually, a cunning youkai - a satori - managed to outmaneuver all other parties, and won.\nDespite all of that, Former Hell still is our subject de jure. Fortunately, [CRD.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetName] are on good terms with each other, and discussions have started if Chireiden shall recognize the Crown of the Yamaxanadu as their liege."

Our mistress cares little about the life of humans, but back then the Hakurei Shrine was also her home. Naturally, the spirit travelled to Makai and defeated Shinki single handedly.\nWhile the defeat has been humiliating for the goddess in the past, the threat of Makai still lingers. Makai must fall if we want to avenge our mistress!"

Her science, just like Rika's, is nothing compared to our magic. Yet, our former apprentice Marisa struggled with Yumemi quite some time ago, and the threat of the Hypervessel still prevails.

While we don't have any personal grudge with Yuuka, our former friend-enemy Reimu Hakurei had to deal with Yuuka. According to our mistress' records, Yuuka is a dangerous youkai even for Old Gensokyo relations.\nThere is, however, one thing thing of the Sunflower Fields, which is of our mistress' interests: Yuuka uses special seeds for her sunflowers to bloom during every season.

While the parts for the new body are gathered, another important element needs to be created for the reincarnation: a Hourai Potion, which grants the mortal body true immortality - the best of both worlds!\nHourai Elixirs are, however, not easy to make and require ingredients from all over the world. Fortunately, we are not bound to morals and ethic, and don't have to make this goose hunt. The two immortals, Kaguya and Mokou of the Bamboo Forest, drunk a Hourai Elixir in the past.

 MIM_magical_power_desc: "With the forceful removal of the pesky lunarians and the collection of the Hourai Extract, the path is clear for the creation of a new Hourai Elixir for our mistress' new body. The only thing left is a catalyst, which allows the extract to turn into the actual potion. Usually, the magical gold of the Moon would suffice, but as we are dealing with a finished extract instead of raw materials, a more aggressive and energetic source of power is needed - a lightning of the Dragon God itself is needed. Fortunately, we don't have to dabble in the realm of divinity to receive it though as there is a youkai, who can borrow the Dragon's power: Iku Nagae.\nHowever, Iku will most likely not support vengeful spirits such as us, and will hide in the chaotic Heaven. If we want to harness the power of the Dragon God we will have to occupy every single hiding spot in Heaven."

 flavor_mim.4.desc: "We have officially established contact with Marisa again. At first, she wanted to blast a new hole in our ambassador with a Master Spark, but fortunately for them, the message of Mima's return gave Marisa pause. The witch accepted our offer of an official state relationship between the two realms.\nHowever, in the end it still is Mima's final verdict of what shall happen with the Forest of Magic."

 flavor_mim.6.t: "A Shrine, a Spirit and the Power of Gensokyo"
 flavor_mim.6.desc: "Reimu has always been Mima's favorite target for all kind of spells, but the vengeful spirit never wished to eliminate the shrine maiden. The Hakurei Shrine is not only a cultural and political important center of Gensokyo, but it is also a nexus point of divine magic of the gods of Gensokyo - amplified by the illusive Hakurei god. A place like this is perfect for the mistress to cast a new spell of divine magic for the realm!"

 flavor_mim.12.desc: "Ever since the great schism of the Hakurei faith, the vengeful spirit Mima has withdrawn from the public eyes. For the most part, the south of Gensokyo has forgotten Mima's existence, and was mostly busy with their own issues.\nBut now they have to react as the evil once-spirit has now returned, more powerful and influential than ever before.

She claims that a great part of her knowledge is from Satori, the mistress of Chireiden, when she tried to possess her. Due to the mind manipulative skills of the Komeijis, Mizuchi is only able to recall only one useful skill however. She asks Mima what type of magic school this skill should be related to..."
 flavor_mim.14.t: "The Master of Gensokyo"
 flavor_mim.14.desc: "A long time ago, our great realm was nothing more than a collection of sealed spirits from Hokora. Eventually, one of us gathered enough strength to break free. This very person was our mistress Mima, who caused enough troubles to Reimu to indirectly cause the schism.\nJust like how our mistress broke free from her seal to unleash her might on the Hakurei Shrine, so did we expand beyond the boundaries of the World of Fantasies in order to become the new masters of Gensokyo."

 flavor_mim.15.desc: "The sunflowers of the Sunflower Field appear to be harmless. But as soon a fool starts collecting their seeds, they will notice that these flowers are anything but harmless. They are the source of Yuuka's power, and in order to maintain and grow their power, the great youkai has imbued lost souls to the seed and channeled highly unstable magic into them.\nIt's a mystery to us how Yuuka even manages to keep these flowers alive without blowing up half of Gensokyo, and our mistress Mima even noted that it is in our interest to not touch anymore seeds than necessary for her goals. Fortunately, we already picked a little bit more than needed, so the remaining ones can be used for a powerful spell."

Mima knows the full list out of memory, but neither us nor our mistress are interested in such quest. Such lowly matters are a task for ordinary magicians.\nNo, our mistress has a better way to get the ingredients for a new potion. Through a complicated multi-step ritual, Mima manages to extract a portion of the Hourai Elixir out of the two captured immortals.

The Moon has fallen, and is now proper of [Root.GetName], though many of the elite guard still try to cling to their dying state. What they don't know is that the power of the spirits is accelerated on the moon - powerful enough to even possess the bodies of the Lunarian Elite Forces, and turn them agains their fellow kind!"

But that beacon started to fail. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s commands became more and more suicidal, and paranoia rised within our own ranks! It went so bad that lunarians raised their weapons against their own kin!\nAt this moment it was clear what happened: the vengeful spirit Mima sent her underlings, and used them to possess [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_mim.18.a: "The end is nigh!"

Yumeko, a loyal aide to goddess Shinki and Makai's chief maid, does not express that, but rather appears to be distressed from a surge in work. For this loyal and firm maid, goddess Shinki decided to collect excellent maids. in Gensokyo - and if they exist in the Outworld - the best maids will now have to help Yumeko to serve Shinki!"

For the most part, the relationship between these youkai and [Root.GetName] is a peaceful one.\nHowever, from time to time one youkai becomes especially feral, mutating into a more demonic form and causing chaos and death - a fate which the province [feral_youkai_province.GetName] has to go through right now. In times like these our realm needs somebody who can hunt youkais, and this as soon as possible!"
