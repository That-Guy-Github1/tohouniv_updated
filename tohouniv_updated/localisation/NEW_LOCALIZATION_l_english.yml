 HIG_take_over_chireiden_desc: "Former Hell was once our realm of operation. But due to the sheer overpopulation of evil spirits, demons and other creatures of the underworld, Higan needed to expand. Due to the bureaucratic issues, Eiki Shiki, Supreme Judge of Gensokyo, then decided split Higan into two regions: Hell and Former Hell.\nWhile Higan was ruled by Eiki, Former Hell was under direct control of Hecatia. But the goddess preferred to have somebody else doing her work, and so she decided to drop the claim entirely, turning Former Hell into a battle field between the satoris, the onis and the spirits.\n\nEventually, Satori Komeiji seized power over Former Hell and became its absolute ruler. Despite all these events, Former Hell still is sovereign territory of [Root.GetName]. We should remind Satori about that."

These beings cause continental incidents, which bring only chaos and discord to the mortals and youkai alike. Fortunately, there are shrine maidens and religious heads, who resolve these incidents as fast as possible - most notably Reimu Hakurei.\nHowever, incidents are only one issue. The other is the utter religious chaos reigning in Gensokyo. We will have to side with one of the great religions if we want to bring unity to the continent."

For the most part, the Animal Realm has been reigned by three \"gangs\" which are ruling by the rule of the strongest.\nThe great Yamaxanadu has rarely reason to meddle with the strife of the Matriarchs. However, when when word reached Eiki that the gang leaders are enslaving the human spirits in order to create an army, as well as the involvement of a goddess to subdue the gang leaders, it became clear to our realm that Animal Realm needs to be governed by the yama instead of these animals."

Admittedly, she and the other two sages are responsible for the creation of Gensokyo in the first place, but neither of them saw it as necessary to regulate youkai society nor to enforce the laws these very sages have created in the first place.\nIt is time to teach humility and responsibility to the gap youkai."

Kaguya and Mokou are these mentioned immortal rivals, who kill each other on a daily basis. Due to their immortal status, there is no reason to lecture them in the first place - after all they will never reach the Grand Courtroom in the first place.\nThere is one issue though: their constant deaths irritate the shinigami of Higan. Whenever either of them gets slain, the shinigami get a notification through their senses, which result in their departure to obtain the new soul. When they reach the \"corpse\", however, they find a living a breathing immortal instead, wasting the shinigami's time. We have to end their daily brawls once and for all."

It's also the organization, which creates the laws and rules which are used to judge a soul. The yama are direct subordinates of this ministry and our actions are the will of the 10 Kings of the Ministry.\nBut their influence was not meant to be forever. The 10 Kings are exceptional judges, but their sense for economy has been severely lacking. Eventually, the kings pawned Higan and their other territories in Gensokyo to Hecatia. It is clear that the once mighty Ministry of Right and Wrong is a shell of what it once was. It is time to establish our Ministry!"

This brought peace within the continent while also protected it from the humans who are all too eager to set foot on Gensokyo. But as fortunate wanted it, the barrier cracked and broke.

These jizos then got selected by the Ten Kings in order to become the yama we know today.\nDue to the financial bankruptcy of the former Ten Kings, the Ministry of Right and Wrong fell in Hecatia's care. As a result, there has been a lack of new yamas to cover the exponential growth of the souls which need judgement. Hecatia promised to take care of it, but her eccentric nature makes her quite unreliable.

 HIG_yama_influence_in_south_east_asia_desc: "The island Java houses great temples for both the Buddhistic and the Hinduistic faith. Religion itself is not really a matter of the yama, but Buddhism and Hinduism are special: both faiths played a key role in the origin of the first Japenese jizo, and later the first yama. In order to improve ourselves, we need to understand our origins and the virtues and sins of the religions of our ancestors.\nThe province [2690.GetName] houses two of the most impressive temples of each of the religions.

Of course there are differences between the Japenese-Gensokyan yama and the Indian yama, but the core is the same.\nIt would be wise to study the Hindu faith for our benefit."

The tributes, which the souls carry with them, are the main source of power. In a way, the shinigami are responsible for the economical growth of [Root.GetName].\nHowever, their leader, Komachi Onozuka, has a tendency to slack with her job. A lot. While she is a person of a nice heart, her behavior is irresponsible. Komachi managed to gain privileges from Hecatia, which allow the shinigami to be as lazy as they desire. As long these privileges are in effect there is little hope to get the shinigami back to fulfil their duty."

They fought countless battles for a religious war they never won.\nIn the end, however, all these great religious figures have lost their followership and their political power. As such, the matter of a spread of any of these religions has become obsolete to the great Yamaxanadu."

Fortunately for us, the former ruler, Satori Komeiji, is offering us a solution: we legitimize Satori Komeiji as the undisputed ruler of Former Hell and Chireiden. Additionally, Satori requests a position as lay judge for petty souls, as well as the jury for the grant trials in the Yama Courtroom.\nIn return Satori pledges absolute loyalty to the crown of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and ensures her support in all battles ahead."

Their respective leaders are trying to convince the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that they should get the official legitimation for their belief."

Although all three have formidable power and influence, all three fear the immense authority Eiki Shiki radiates.\nAll three matriarchs stand trial for disturbing the stability of hell, unnecessary cruelty which goes way beyond what is seen as necessary and for their threat to the safety of Gensokyo as a whole.\nAll three present their case and their defense, but in the end they have to oblige to Eiki's judgement: \"I hereby declare all of you as guilty...\""

Eventurally, the 10 Kings - the rulers of the Ministry - pawned Higan and their other territories in Gensokyo to Hecatia. Ever since their influence over the yama has been more and more diminishing, and as a result the rules for the yama have become quite dated.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] made the bold decision to found a new Ministry of Right and Wrong, which is specialized for the cases of Gensokyo.

But one trait of hers played against her in the long last: her hubris.\nAlthough Yukari always avoided a direct confrontation with the great Yamaxanadu Eiki Shiki, she made the arrogant mistake to think that the yamas have no military experience whatsoever, and underestimated our tactical maneuvers.\nIn the end, Mayohiga has been defeated. The realm has been humiliated and their mistress was finally forced to face the lectures of the Yamaxanadu."

Meanwhile, Kaguya accuses Mokou of scamming as Mokou's family promised to deliver the Five Impossible Requests, yet not only have failed this task but also send their daughter Mokou to assassinate Kaguya.\n\nObviously, both immortals are telling a warped and biased version of the same story.
