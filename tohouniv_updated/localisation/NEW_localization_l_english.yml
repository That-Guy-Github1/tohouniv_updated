 ###MISSIONS FOR NET###
 NET_reinforce_the_border_title: "Reinforce the Border"
 NET_reinforce_the_border_desc: "Gensokyo is split not only in several normal areas but also different dimensions, which all have their own purposes. Netherworld is one of them and has the purpose to house the guitless phantoms, undead and what not until their reincarnation.\nMost recently, the border between the world of the living and the Netherworld has become flimsy. We should reinforce it so the living won't be less able to enter our realm."
 NET_elimiate_seiga_title: "Banish Seiga"
 NET_elimiate_seiga_desc: "Seiga Kaku is a Taoist, a necromancer and secretly the headmaster of her own necromancer school. If our people wants to have any peace from her and the threat caused by her students we have to attack her home and expel her from Gensokyo!"
 NET_battle_of_the_swordsmen_title: "Swordsmen Battles"
 NET_battle_of_the_swordsmen_desc: "Organizing an army is one thing, but leading one is a whole different story. If Youmu wishes to ascend in her rank she needs to show her skills on the battlefield.\nWhile winning fights against other armies is impressive, Yuyuko suggests that Youmu should showcase her abilities in a duel against the legendary samurai Meira. Of course normal won battles would suffice too."
 NET_battle_of_the_swordsmen_ct: "Win a battle with a unit lead by §YYoumu Konpaku§! against an enemy unit, which is lead by the [OKR.Monarch.GetTitle] of §Y[OKR.GetName]§!."

 NET_train_the_troops_title: "Lead to Victory!"
 NET_train_the_troops_desc: "Youmu makes fast progress in her military career. Now she has to prove herself in the management of warfare - and there's no better opportunity to show her skills than a victorious war against an enemy who is more fearsome than us (if it is even possible)."
 NET_train_the_troops_tt: "Any country with more development than [Root.GetName] is at war with us and has less than §R-25§! Warscore"

 NET_consolidate_gensokyan_trade_title: "Consolidate Trade Node"
 NET_consolidate_gensokyan_trade_desc: "While Yuyuko enjoys the many cuisines of the Outworld, they still need to find their way to Gensokyo first before they can be served. In order to get the food to Yuyuko's table instead of some wild youkai, we need to consolidate the trade of the Forest of Magic and the Hakurei Shrine."
 NET_food_monopoly_title: "Cuisine Monopoly"
 NET_food_monopoly_desc: "Now that we have control over the influx of the many foods of the world to Gensokyo, we can establish a monopoly over it. No bad meal will ever reach anyone of Gensokyo as long we are here!"
 NET_conquer_fujiwara_title: "Put out the Phoenix"
 NET_conquer_fujiwara_desc: "Unlike the other realms of Gensokyo Netherworld is filled with ghosts, phantoms and spirits. Because of our unique population most of the livings try to avoid us. But there are always some suicidal people - like our friendly neighbours in the north, in the Bamboo Forest.\nMokou and Kaguya have a fight every day and it causes our mistress some serious headaches. Worst of all though, the flames Mokou cause has been witnessed to spread even into the Netherworld itself! Killing her is no option due to immortality, but we can force her to move away from us by taking over her part of the Bamboo Forest and using its resources for our capital."
 NET_the_yama_question_title: "Netherworld and the Yama"
 NET_the_yama_question_desc: "The Netherworld is as old as Gensokyo itself and was originally under the management of the yama. Due to the lack of resources, the yama decided to transfer this task to somebody, who lives locally within Netherworld, which at this time was none other than our good mistress Yuyuko herself.\nEver since Netherworld has been de jure a vassal of Higan. However, the grasp of the yama over the Netherworld has been dwindling. While it is good for us in the short term, mistress Yuyuko fears that this might be the first sign of the yama losing complete control over the after life. We have to cease their position of power and take over the judgement of the dead before Higan totally collapses!"
 NET_solve_the_border_friction_title: "Expel the Princess"
 NET_solve_the_border_friction_desc: "Unlike the other realms of Gensokyo Netherworld is filled with ghosts, phantoms and spirits. Because of our unique population most of the livings try to avoid us. But there are always some suicidal people - like our friendly neighbours in the north, in the Bamboo Forest.\n Kaguya endangered over and over again the spirit barrier between Gensokyo and the Netherworld with her fights and is a considerable threat to the safety of Netherworld and the well-being of Yuyuko. While death is not a solution, we can at least expel her away from our borders by taking over her acursed part of the Bamboo Forest."
 NET_conquer_mima_title: "Return Mima to Peace"
 NET_conquer_mima_desc: "Not all spirits managed to be kept within Hell, Former Hell or Netherworld. Some managed to find their way into the world of the living all by their own and are causing chaos out there. The most prominent ghost is Mima herself, the vengeful spirit, which even managed to defeat the goddess Shinki in the past.\nWhile we usually don't care too much about what happens in the world of the mortals, Yuyuko considers Mima to be important enough to be integrated into Netherworld's society instead of letting her continue rampaging in Gensokyo."
 ###EVENTS FOR NET###
 flavor_net.4.t: "Ambush of a Necromancer"
 flavor_net.4.desc: "It was a normal day like any other in Netherworld. The flower blossomed and [Root.Monarch.GetName] enjoyed their beauty. However, this peace was short lived as she got interrupted by a seemingly random volley of magical bullets. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] managed to dodge them barely as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attacker revealed herself from the shadow of the Demon Tree. \"Yes, yes! You will make an excellent servant!\"\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] heard rumors of Taoist necromancers trying to subjugate the undead of Gensokyo. But [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] never thought the day would come that one would have the audacity to invade [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] home dimension and try to enslave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]!"

 flavor_net.5.desc: "The necromancer was no challenge for [Root.Monarch.GetName]. However, this was only one of them and there could be many more in Gensokyo. To eliminate the threat of the necromancers, their headmaster, Seiga Kaku, needs to be take down! Fortunately, this attack gives more than any right for justifying a war against [SNK.GetName]."

 flavor_net.100.t: "Treatment of the Living"
 flavor_net.100.desc: "Unlike many other realms of Gensokyo, our [Root.GovernmentName] is one inhabited by ghosts and the undead. As such, we need to introduce a policy when we have mortals within our realm. The question is, how should we treat them?"

 yuyus_food_hunt.100.desc: "The Ghost Monarchy is not any monarchy run by ghosts but a government modelled entirely after Yuyuko's interests and personality. As such, it is no wonder that it also takes great care of collecting the many foreign cuisines of the world.\n\nEvery foreign culture outside the culture group of [Root.GetName] grants us a stack of 'Foreign Cuisines'. These buffs are only applied if we get access to a NEW foreign culture, that means conquering more provinces of a foreign culture which cuisine has already been integrated into our society brings no benefit.\n'Foreign Cuisines' grants our [Root.GovernmentName] following effects per stack:\nGlobal Trade Power: §G+1.0%§!\nTrade Steering: §G+1.0%§!\nYearly Corruption: §G-0.01§!\nAdministrative Efficiency: §G+1.0%§!\n\n'Foreign Cuisines' can reach up to 100 stacks, which would have at its highest power following effect:\nGlobal Trade Power: §G+100.0%§!\nTrade Steering: §G+100.0%§!\nYearly Corruption: §G-1.0§!\nAdministrative Efficiency: §G+10.0%§!\n\nAdditionally, the Ghost Monarchy enables the choice of picking a 'Mortal Policy', which grants us a significant bonus. However, swapping a policy for another will always cost 1 Stability."

 ###MISSIONS FOR MHG###
 MHG_the_great_sages_of_gensokyo_title: "Unite the Sages"
 MHG_the_great_sages_of_gensokyo_desc: "Ever wondered how Gensokyo came into existence in the first place? I know you can't answer, so I just assume you said yes.\nAround the time when you humans started industrializing and constructing machinery you stopped your belief in the demons, supernatural creatures and ghosts. You became \"\"\"enlightened\"\"\" (well, as enlightened a human could be that is) and as such seized to believe in said creatures, the youkai. Well, that was not good for our kind so the sages of Gensokyo formed a group and created the Hakurei Barrier, closing a part of Japan off from the rest of the world, where the youkai can live in peace.\n\nI suppose you have noticed two key points here though: first, I was talking about the industrialization while here in fact you are still in like the Age of Discovery. Secondly, I noted a \"part of Japan\", and, well, your Gensokyo is considerably larger. Please don't let your immersion ruined by this contradiction. Just imagine this Gensokyo is an alternate reality.\nAnyway, where was I? Ah right, the Barrier. In this universe the barrier broke - don't ask me why. Just gather the sages together and we can start \"restoring\" it."
 MHG_collect_resources_title: "Gather the Resources"
 MHG_collect_resources_desc: "Alright, now that our little group is united again it is time to get working on the border. Or at least I would like to if it wouldn't for the little fact that we need magical resources to construct this barrier. You know, making walls isn't cheap. Would you be so nice and look for them while Okina, Kasen and I enjoy some tea? That would be very nice of you, human. Here, take this list of stuff you need to gather."
 income_from_metal_spice_and_clothes: "from any type of §YMetal§!, §YSpice§! and §YCloth§! productions."
 MHG_collect_resources_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains for every subject §G1§! year worth of $COST|Y$¤ from any type of the subject's §YMetal§!, §YSpice§! and §YCloth§! productions."
 MHG_form_own_army_title: "Recruit some Troops"
 MHG_form_own_army_desc: "Alright, how do you play this game? Moment, just give me a few seconds to play through the tutorial and.. ah! Okay, human, do as I say and we get our pretty blob over the continent. First, build some troops and focus on sword mana. You will need to crack some skulls.\n\nOh, right, I suppose you want some reward, don't you? Well, you can have a general version of my favourite cat, Chen. That shall do."
 MHG_hire_mercs_title: "Summon the Mercs"
 MHG_hire_mercs_desc: "You know what, I think normal soldiers don't cut it for my beloved purple blob. They take too much time to get into the action and have no special abilities other than dying in a pointless war. I think it is better that we focus on more interesting and less incompetent armies - like mercenary companies. Don't worry, they will be worth it. My boundary skills will make sure of that."
 MHG_great_merc_army_title: "The Great Merc Army"
 MHG_great_merc_army_desc: "I know we already have like three mercenary companies in our army, but I think we should double down with the mercenaries. They are quite handy and we will need more of them to fight bigger wars. Of course you can supplement them with normal troops... buuuut then you could just have picked any other country instead."
 MHG_only_the_best_merc_title: "My personal Elite Force"
 MHG_only_the_best_merc_desc: "Alright, we had mercenaries in action and even more in our army. However, I amm not quite content with them just yet. As you can see, there are many more mercenaries on the world, and those from the Outworld might have the punch needed for becoming my elite force - basically my next royal guard. \"Why?\" you ask? Well, somebody with my power wouldn't really *need* an army like that, but I like the idea of having a personal royal guard.\nAnyway, to form such prestigious contiment I need some test mercenaries who could fulfil this role. Would you be so kind and recruit four foreign companies and get the army tradition up?"
 MHG_might_of_the_gap_hag_title: "The Puppet Master"
 MHG_might_of_the_gap_hag_desc: "While fighting wars can be quite exciting, it is also a very exhausting job. You need to carpet siege your enemies, make sure you don't run out of manpower, your pesky peasants complain about \"War Exhaustion\" and all that stuff. Don't you think it would be much nicer to have a subject - or a LOT of subjects - do the heavy lift instead? Just make sure that this government reform mana goes up and I will give you some nice reform."
 MHG_insult_the_moon_people_title: "Insult the Moon People"
 MHG_insult_the_moon_people_desc: "A long time ago I lead youkais into a war against the lunarians. It was... quite the experience for both parties: dead piles of rabbit bodies for the lunarians and mass youkai graves for my side. In the end, the youkais begged to me to end this campaign and call for a truce with the lunarians, which they begrudgingly agreed on to.\nWhat I didn't tell to these youkais is that I never made official peace with the lunarians. To this day, Gensokyo is still at war with them on paper. Come! Let us remind these pesky lunarians that they are still just filth!"
