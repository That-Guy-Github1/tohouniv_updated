 ###MISSIONS FOR NET###
 NET_reinforce_the_border_title: "Reinforce the Border"
 NET_reinforce_the_border_desc: "Gensokyo is split not only in several normal areas but also different dimensions, which all have their own purposes. Netherworld is one of them and has the purpose to house the guiltless phantoms, undead and what not until their reincarnation.\nMost recently, the border between the world of the living and the Netherworld has become flimsy. We should reinforce it so the living won't be less able to enter our realm."
 NET_elimiate_seiga_title: "Banish Seiga"
 NET_elimiate_seiga_desc: "Seiga Kaku is a Taoist, a necromancer and secretly the headmaster of her own necromancer school. If our people want to have any peace from her and the threat caused by her students we have to attack her home and expel her from Gensokyo!"
 NET_battle_of_the_swordsmen_title: "Swordsmen Battles"
 NET_battle_of_the_swordsmen_desc: "Organizing an army is one thing, but leading one is a whole different story. If Youmu wishes to ascend in her rank she needs to show her skills on the battlefield.\nWhile winning fights against other armies is impressive, Yuyuko suggests that Youmu should showcase her abilities in a duel against the legendary samurai Meira. Of course normal won battles would suffice too."
 NET_battle_of_the_swordsmen_ct: "Win a battle with a unit lead by §YYoumu Konpaku§! against an enemy unit, which is lead by the [OKR.Monarch.GetTitle] of §Y[OKR.GetName]§!."
 NET_battle_of_the_swordsmen_tt: "Win at least §Y25§! (§Y[Root.net_battle_counter.GetValue]§!/§Y25§!) battles. Fights, which are won by unit which has §YYoumu Konpaku§! assigned count §Ytwice§!."
 NET_battle_of_the_swordsmen_at: "The conditions for this mission reveal when the mission '§YLevy a ghostly army§!' has been completed."
 NET_train_the_troops_title: "Lead to Victory!"
 NET_train_the_troops_desc: "Youmu makes fast progress in her military career. Now she has to prove herself in the management of warfare - and there's no better opportunity to show her skills than a victorious war against an enemy who is more fearsome than us (if it is even possible)."
 NET_train_the_troops_tt: "Any country with more development than [Root.GetName] is at war with us and has less than §Y-25§! Warscore"
 NET_train_the_troops_at: "No known country has more development than §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
 NET_train_the_troops_ct: "General §YYoumu Konpaku§!'s stats will be set to §Y6§!/§Y5§!/§Y6§!/§Y4§!"
 NET_choose_mortal_policy_title: "Choose Mortal Policy"
 NET_choose_mortal_policy_desc: "Netherworld is no normal realm but a world for the ghosts and undead. However, the majority of the rest of the world are living mortals and as such we need to determine our policy of how we should deal with the mortals within our realm."
 NET_consolidate_gensokyan_trade_title: "Consolidate Trade Node"
 NET_consolidate_gensokyan_trade_desc: "While Yuyuko enjoys the many cuisines of the Outworld, they still need to find their way to Gensokyo first before they can be served. In order to get the food to Yuyuko's table instead of some wild youkai, we need to consolidate the trade of the Forest of Magic and the Hakurei Shrine."
 NET_food_monopoly_title: "Cuisine Monopoly"
 NET_food_monopoly_desc: "Now that we have control over the influx of the many foods of the world to Gensokyo, we can establish a monopoly over it. No bad meal will ever reach anyone in Gensokyo as long as we are here!"
 NET_conquer_fujiwara_title: "Put out the Phoenix"
 NET_conquer_fujiwara_desc: "Unlike the other realms of Gensokyo, Netherworld is filled with ghosts, phantoms and spirits. Because of our unique population most of the living try to avoid us. But there are always some suicidal people - like our friendly neighbours in the north, in the Bamboo Forest.\nMokou and Kaguya have a fight every day and it causes our mistress some serious headaches. Worst of all though, the flames Mokou causes have been witnessed to spread even into the Netherworld itself! Killing her is no option due to immortality, but we can force her to move away from us by taking over her part of the Bamboo Forest and using its resources for our capital."
 NET_the_yama_question_title: "Netherworld and the Yama"
 NET_the_yama_question_desc: "The Netherworld is as old as Gensokyo itself and was originally under the management of the yama. Due to the lack of resources, the yama decided to transfer this task to somebody, who lives locally within Netherworld, which at this time was none other than our good mistress Yuyuko herself.\nEver since Netherworld has been de jure a vassal of Higan. However, the grasp of the yama over the Netherworld has been dwindling. While it is good for us in the short term, mistress Yuyuko fears that this might be the first sign of the yama losing complete control over the afterlife. We have to cease their position of power and take over the judgement of the dead before Higan totally collapses!"
 NET_solve_the_border_friction_title: "Expel the Princess"
 NET_solve_the_border_friction_desc: "Unlike the other realms of Gensokyo Netherworld is filled with ghosts, phantoms and spirits. Because of our unique population most of the living try to avoid us. But there are always some suicidal people - like our friendly neighbours in the north, in the Bamboo Forest.\n Kaguya endangered over and over again the spirit barrier between Gensokyo and the Netherworld with her fights and is a considerable threat to the safety of Netherworld and the well-being of Yuyuko. While death is not a solution, we can at least expel her away from our borders by taking over her accursed part of the Bamboo Forest."
 NET_conquer_mima_title: "Return Mima to Peace"
 NET_conquer_mima_desc: "Not all spirits managed to be kept within Hell, Former Hell or Netherworld. Some managed to find their way into the world of the living all on their own and are causing chaos out there. The most prominent ghost is Mima herself, the vengeful spirit, which even managed to defeat the goddess Shinki in the past.\nWhile we usually don't care too much about what happens in the world of the mortals, Yuyuko considers Mima to be important enough to be integrated into Netherworld's society instead of letting her continue rampaging in Gensokyo."
 NET_open_the_grand_cuisine_title: "Open the Grand Market"
 NET_open_the_grand_cuisine_desc: "Our good mistress Yuyuko Saigyouji is an enjoyer of the many exotic cuisines of the world. However, even if we happen to get access to these cuisines we will need a place to store all the valuable food and ingredients. A market for [Root.Capital.GetName] would be an excellent solution."
 ###EVENTS FOR NET###
 flavor_net.4.t: "Ambush of a Necromancer"
 flavor_net.4.desc: "It was a normal day like any other in Netherworld. The flower blossomed and [Root.Monarch.GetName] enjoyed their beauty. However, this peace was short lived as she got interrupted by a seemingly random volley of magical bullets. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] managed to dodge them barely as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attacker revealed herself from the shadow of the Demon Tree. \"Yes, yes! You will make an excellent servant!\"\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] heard rumors of Taoist necromancers trying to subjugate the undead of Gensokyo. But [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] never thought the day would come that one would have the audacity to invade [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] home dimension and try to enslave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]!"
 flavor_net.4.a: "How DARE you attack me?!"
 flavor_net.4.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between the necromancer and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!."
 flavor_net.5.t: "The Seiga Threat"
 flavor_net.5.desc: "The necromancer was no challenge for [Root.Monarch.GetName]. However, this was only one of them and there could be many more in Gensokyo. To eliminate the threat of the necromancers, their headmaster, Seiga Kaku, needs to be taken down! Fortunately, this attack gives more than any right for justifying a war against [SNK.GetName]."
 flavor_net.5.a: "Seiga is a threat to my people. She must be stopped!"
 flavor_mhg.51.t: "The Sages of Gensokyo"
 flavor_mhg.51.desc: "Long time ago, Kasen, Okina and I created the Hakurei Barrier in order to protect the youkai from the rapidly growing influence of human technology. After that me and the girls didn't really have many opportunities to do anything together.\nFortunately, the barrier broke in this dimension and we can finally have some fun together. You know, having a nice tea party, speculating who in Gensokyo goes out with Rinnosuke and restoring the great border - thanks to you human!"
 flavor_mhg.51.a: "You're welcome old sage."
 flavor_net.100.t: "Treatment of the Living"
 flavor_net.100.desc: "Unlike many other realms of Gensokyo, our [Root.GovernmentName] is one inhabited by ghosts and the undead. As such, we need to introduce a policy when we have mortals within our realm. The question is, how should we treat them?"
 flavor_net.100.a: "The living shall live among our people in harmony."
 flavor_net.100.b: "Just separate both groups from each other and be tolerant to them."
 flavor_net.100.c: "Repress the living and turn them into the dead!"
 flavor_net.102.t: "Youmu Konpaku ready for Duty"
 flavor_net.102.desc: "In times of need our great gardener and samurai Youmu Konpaku will help [Root.Monarch.GetName] out wherever she can. Be it as militaristic advisor or as general - her service is always welcomed here."
 flavor_net.102.a: "Youmu must help us with the army organization."
 flavor_net.102.b: "Youmu shall lead the armies to victory!"
 flavor_net.103.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] wishes for a Meal"
 flavor_net.103.desc: "Our collection of the many cuisines of the world allows Youmu a higher access to the many meals she can prepare for [Root.Monarch.GetName]. However, the ingredients can become quite pricey, so she has to choose what shall be made for her [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 flavor_net.103.a: "A Mediterranean meal for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 flavor_net.103.b: "A West European meal for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 flavor_net.103.c: "A Middle European meal for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 flavor_net.103.zzz: "[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] needs no more meals."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.5.t: "The Growth of [Root.GetName]"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.5.desc: "Our [Root.GovernmentName] has grown to new extends - way beyond what our overlord can handle to have as a daimyo. The time has come to either get a promotion or to declare independence!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.5.a: "Promotion time!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.5.a.tt: "We will ask [mhg_overlord.GetName] to promote us to a §YSpecial March§!."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.5.b: "We have grown too much to remain a slave!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.5.c: "In [mhg_overlord.Monarch.GetName] we trust and stay loyal to!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.6.t: "[From.GetName] demands Promotion"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.6.desc: "It appears one of your daimyos is ambitious. They have grown to such an extent that they found the courage to ask you for a promotion to a special march. How will you react, human?"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.6.a: "A March sounds good."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.6.a.tt: "§RThis action will pull [Root.GetName] over the March Limit!§!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.6.b: "I have a better idea: [From.Monarch.GetName] shall redistribute their land instead."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.6.b.tt: "[From.GetName] will be forced to release all annexed nations and give one province back."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.6.c: "They are not worth the time and effort."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.7.t: "Promotion successful!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.7.desc: "[From.GetName] has shown wisdom and has promoted us to a March of Yukari!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.7.a: "Awesome!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.8.t: "[From.GetName] demands Redistribution!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.8.desc: "[From.Monarch.GetName] refused our plea. Even worse, [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] now demands of us to give some of our provinces back and release all annexed countries!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.8.a: "*Sigh* Fine..."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.8.b: "Aw hell no. We would rather fight than follow their orders!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.9.t: "[From.GetName] granted us Independence!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.9.desc: "[From.Monarch.GetName] has decided that we aren't worth the trouble and released us into independence. Our fate is in our hands again."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.9.a: "Okay."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.11.t: "Too many Marches!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.11.desc: "Your realm has more Marches than you can handle. I think you know what will happen now? I will send the mails to your marches"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.11.a: "What a great help you are, Yukari..."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.11.a.tt: "I heard that. Oh well, your problem now.\n\nAll §YMarches of Yukari§! get the choice to revert back to be a §YDaimyo of Yukari§! or to declare a §YWar for Independence§! against [Root.GetName]."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.12.t: "Non-functioning Administration of [From.GetName]"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.12.desc: "The amount of Marches of [From.GetName] is way higher than they can handle. To fix their administrative issues, the fools have decided to force all their marches to return to daimyos!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.12.a: "We follow the order of [From.GetName]!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.12.a.tt: "[Root.GetName] will revert back to being a §YDaimyo§!."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.12.b: "NEVER! We would rather fight than stay a slave!"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.100.t: "The Daimyo System of Mayohiga"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.100.desc: "Alright, human, listen up! I will explain to you how Mayohiga operates!\nUnlike these barbaric neighbors you have, your realm - Mayohiga - doesn't use its own troops and soldiers for fighting. Instead we have Daimyos - a bunch of vassals who think they have a free will, but are in the end our subjects. They can declare wars on their own and expand without us having to support them. That comes however with the drawback that they might grow too rapidly, which makes them think they can take on with you. In such cases you have the option to either demand their collapse (which of course will displease them) or make them your March. Marches are much more obedient and don't cause as much trouble, but will occupy one of your March Slots. If you have more marches than March Slots, your marches will get the choice to either revert back to daimyo - and repeat this cycle - or will declare independence war upon you. So be sure you are using your marches wisely.\nOther than that your realm is pretty easy to handle. Any questions?"
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.100.a: "No mam."
 th_yukari_daimyo_mechanic.100.a.tt: "Good. Now get vassalizing!"

 yuyus_food_hunt.100.desc: "The Ghost Monarchy is not any monarchy run by ghosts but a government modelled entirely after Yuyuko's interests and personality. As such, it is no wonder that it also takes great care of collecting the many foreign cuisines of the world.\n\nEvery foreign culture outside the culture group of [Root.GetName] grants us a stack of 'Foreign Cuisines'. These buffs are only applied if we get access to a NEW foreign culture, that means conquering more provinces of a foreign culture which cuisine has already been integrated into our society brings no benefit.\n'Foreign Cuisines' grants our [Root.GovernmentName] following effects per stack:\nGlobal Trade Power: §G+1.0%§!\nTrade Steering: §G+1.0%§!\nYearly Corruption: §G-0.01§!\nAdministrative Efficiency: §G+1.0%§!\n\n'Foreign Cuisines' can reach up to 100 stacks, which would have at its highest power following effect:\nGlobal Trade Power: §G+100.0%§!\nTrade Steering: §G+100.0%§!\nYearly Corruption: §G-1.0§!\nAdministrative Efficiency: §G+10.0%§!\n\nAdditionally, the Ghost Monarchy enables the choice of picking a 'Mortal Policy', which grants us a significant bonus.

 ###MISSIONS FOR MHG###
 MHG_the_great_sages_of_gensokyo_title: "Unite the Sages"
 MHG_the_great_sages_of_gensokyo_desc: "Ever wondered how Gensokyo came into existence in the first place? I know you can't answer, so I just assume you said yes.\nAround the time when you humans started industrializing and constructing machinery you stopped your belief in demons, supernatural creatures and ghosts. You became \"\"\"enlightened\"\"\" (well, as enlightened a human could be that is) and as such ceased to believe in said creatures, the youkai. Well, that was not good for our kind so the sages of Gensokyo formed a group and created the Hakurei Barrier, closing a part of Japan off from the rest of the world, where the youkai can live in peace.\n\nI suppose you have noticed two key points here though: first, I was talking about the industrialization while here in fact you are still in like the Age of Discovery. Secondly, I noted a \"part of Japan\", and, well, your Gensokyo is considerably larger. Please don't let your immersion be ruined by this contradiction. Just imagine that Gensokyo is an alternate reality.\nAnyway, where was I? Ah right, the Barrier. In this universe the barrier broke - don't ask me why. Just gather the sages together and we can start \"restoring\" it."
 MHG_collect_resources_title: "Gather the Resources"
 MHG_collect_resources_desc: "Alright, now that our little group is united again it is time to get working on the border. Or at least I would like to if it wouldn't for the little fact that we need magical resources to construct this barrier. You know, making walls isn't cheap. Would you be so nice and look for them while Okina, Kasen and I enjoy some tea? That would be very nice of you, human.\nYou will need to gather any kind of metal as they will serve as catalysts for the border creation. Clothes will serve as the border between Gensokyo and the world while the spices keep it all together. Don't ask me why spices do this, Okina has tricks which even I can't grasp my head around them."
 income_from_metal_spice_and_clothes: "from any type of §YMetal§!, §YSpice§! and §YCloth§! productions."
 MHG_collect_resources_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains for every subject §G1§! year worth of $COST|Y$¤ from any type of the subject's §YMetal§!, §YSpice§! and §YCloth§! productions."
 MHG_form_own_army_title: "Recruit some Troops"
 MHG_form_own_army_desc: "Alright, how do you play this game? Moment, just give me a few seconds to play through the tutorial and.. ah! Okay, human, do as I say and we get our pretty blob over the continent. First, build some troops and focus on sword mana. You will need to crack some skulls.\n\nOh, right, I suppose you want some reward, don't you? Well, you can have a general version of my favourite cat, Chen. That shall do."
 MHG_hire_mercs_title: "Summon the Mercs"
 MHG_hire_mercs_desc: "You know what, I think normal soldiers don't cut it for my beloved purple blob. They take too much time to get into the action and have no special abilities other than dying in a pointless war. I think it is better that we focus on more interesting and less incompetent armies - like mercenary companies. Don't worry, they will be worth it. My boundary skills will make sure of that."
 MHG_great_merc_army_title: "The Great Merc Army"
 MHG_great_merc_army_desc: "I know we already have like three mercenary companies in our army, but I think we should double down with the mercenaries. They are quite handy and we will need more of them to fight bigger wars. Of course you can supplement them with normal troops... buuuut then you could just have picked any other country instead."
 MHG_only_the_best_merc_title: "My personal Elite Force"
 MHG_only_the_best_merc_desc: "Alright, we had mercenaries in action and even more in our army. However, I amm not quite content with them just yet. As you can see, there are many more mercenaries in the world, and those from the Outworld might have the punch needed for becoming my elite force - basically my next royal guard. \"Why?\" you ask? Well, somebody with my power wouldn't really *need* an army like that, but I like the idea of having a personal royal guard.\nAnyway, to form such a prestigious contingent I need some test mercenaries who could fulfil this role. Would you be so kind and recruit four foreign companies and get the army tradition up?"
 MHG_might_of_the_gap_hag_title: "The Puppet Master"
 MHG_might_of_the_gap_hag_desc: "While fighting wars can be quite exciting, it is also a very exhausting job. You need to carpet siege your enemies, make sure you don't run out of manpower, your pesky peasants complain about \"War Exhaustion\" and all that stuff. Don't you think it would be much nicer to have a subject - or a LOT of subjects - do the heavy lift instead? Just make sure that this government reform mana goes up and I will give you some nice reform."
 MHG_insult_the_moon_people_title: "Insult the Moon People"
 MHG_insult_the_moon_people_desc: "A long time ago, I led the youkai to war against the Lunarians. It was... quite the experience for both parties: dead piles of rabbit bodies for the lunarians and mass youkai graves for my side. In the end, the youkai begged me to end this campaign and call for a truce with the lunarians, which they begrudgingly agreed on.\nWhat I didn't tell these youkai is that I never made official peace with the lunarians. To this day, Gensokyo is still at war with them on paper. Come! Let us remind these pesky lunarians that they are still just filth!"
 MHG_annihilate_the_lunarians_title: "Annihilate the Lunarians"
 MHG_annihilate_the_lunarians_desc: "There is a secret I need to tell you: I didn't order an invasion of the moon for personal gains, or to eradicate the lunarians, but to teach the youkai the misdeeds of war. *Sigh* Considering the state of Gensokyo in this game though, it seems like I have failed, and trying to teach these fools won't suffice.\nMight be better to embrace the chaos and bloodlust, don't you think? Let us annihilate them like the pests they are!"
 MHG_annihilate_the_lunarians_at: "We have won a war against §Y[LEM.GetName]§! in the last §Y20 years§! without having suffered a defeat ourselves by [LEM.GetName] in the last §Y20 years§!."
 MHG_annihilate_the_lunarians_bt: "[Root.GetName] has won a war against §Y[LCU.GetName]§! in the last §Y20 years§!."
 MHG_annihilate_the_lunarians_ct: "[Root.GetName] has NOT lost a war against §Y[LCU.GetName]§! in the last §Y20 years§!."
 MHG_the_spies_of_yukari_title: "Expand Spy Network"
 MHG_the_spies_of_yukari_desc: "There are not many espionage countries in Gensokyo. You could argue that the tengu are spies, but they lack morals in any other kind too, so that doesn't count. Because of that, Mayohiga, this beautiful purple blob, has the role of being the spy master of Gensokyo. But that can't go anywhere if our spynetwork is still so pathetic. Sooo... get spying now!"
 MHG_daimyo_collector_title: "The Great Puppeteer"
 MHG_daimyo_collector_desc: "The world has many little nations who think they are free. Free will is a myth. Their beliefs are jokes. They will all be mine in the end!\n\nOh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you over there, human. I am currently training my victory quote for the day the purple blob vassalized the world. Speaking of, why are you here? We need more daimyos, so get vassalizing!"
 MHG_renovate_mayohiga_title: "Office for Ran"
 MHG_renovate_mayohiga_desc: "As you might have noticed I have the tendency to become really tired with your ... ehm, I mean, I just get really tired at times. As such my good shikigami always takes matters into their own. However, because she lacks a proper office to actually catch up on the stuff you did in my name, she gets overwhelmed with work easily. I think the fox would appreciate it a lot if you create an office in Mayohiga for her so she has an easier time to handle your failures."
 MHG_great_rival_humiliation_title: "Devastate a Great Power"
 MHG_great_rival_humiliation_desc: "I see our purple blob is growing in power. However, is it strong enough to go toe-to-toe with one of the other nations too? Let us test your skills, humans, and let us see if you can defeat them or if you need a 'Lucky' bonus too."
 MHG_great_rival_humiliation_tt: "There is no power on the world left, which could pose a challenge to [Root.GetName].\nCongratulations, you have won the game!"
 MHG_great_rival_humiliation_at: "At least §Y2§! Great Powers are at war with §Y[Root.GetName]§! and have less than §Y-50§! War Score against [Root.GetName]."
 MHG_great_rival_humiliation_bt: "At least §Y2§! countries with at least as much development (own development and subjects' development combined) as [Root.GetName] are at war with §Y[Root.GetName]§! and have less than §Y-50§! War Score against [Root.GetName]."
 MHG_great_rival_humiliation_ct: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! will gain §G25.00§! power projection. This power projection is §Ypermanent§!."
 MHG_vassalize_reimu_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains claims on §YScarlet Devil Mansion§!, §YScarlet Mountain§! and §YScarlet Land§! when the mission '§YSubjugate Marisa§!' is completed."
 MHG_vassalize_marisa_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains claims on §YScarlet Devil Mansion§!, §YScarlet Mountain§! and §YScarlet Land§! when the mission '§YSubjugate Reimu§!' is completed."
 ###MISSIONS FOR MRY###
 MRY_religious_prestige_title: "Moriya Prestige"
 MRY_religious_prestige_desc: "Our clan and our religion are relatively young in Gensokyo, and as such we do not have the respect of this world yet. We should change this and gather the prestige which is our birth right!"
 MRY_religious_treasury_title: "Invest in the Shrine"
 MRY_religious_treasury_desc: "Our dear goddess, Yasaka Kanako, noted that the Moriya Shrine, while being at the perfect location, is nowhere near to be ready for mass visit. She recommends a great investment into the shrine first in order to deal with the many pilgrims the goddess is anticipating."
 MRY_danmaku_barracks_title: "Danmaku Training Fields"
 MRY_danmaku_barracks_desc: "The Moriya Clan arrived in Gensokyo in peace. However, Gensokyo is very much not in the mood for it - youkai race to arms, vampires are trying to conquer the south and a heretic goddess in the north expands her influence. If we want to survive in this harsh environment we will need troops and proper training in the arts of Danmaku fights. Additional Danamku training fields will be required though."
 MRY_danmaku_fights_title: "Fight the Leaders"
 MRY_danmaku_fights_desc: "Having a huge army fighting wars for one is one way to solve conflict, but it is not the only one. Our good shrine maiden Sanae needs to learn how to fight on a personal level. It would be best if she practices it against the other danmaku masters in Gensokyo"
 MRY_reform_the_shrine_title: "Enact Shrine Laws"
 MRY_reform_the_shrine_desc: "The Moriya Clan is yet only a shrine theocracy. Many advanced laws and reforms are still ahead of us; many new ways of gathering faith are yet to be discovered. We should advance the reforms of our government and enact the necessary laws to make faith collection as efficient as possible."
 MRY_reform_the_shrine_ct: "Any country is a §YReligious Tributary§! of [Root.GetName]."
 MRY_mof_incident_title: "Mountain of Faith"
 MRY_mof_incident_desc: "The 'Mountain of Faith' incident - that's how our story will be called in the history books of Gensokyo. It was a time of religious tumolts, movements of reformations and new techniques for conversions."
 MRY_moriya_dominance_title: "The Faith Tributaries"
 MRY_moriya_dominance_desc: "Kanako and Suwako's demand for faith is ever growing, and our usage of faith power has reached new records. We should create more religious tributaries who donate faith and money in exchange for protection!"
 MRY_espionage_title: "Spies of Kanako"
 MRY_espionage_desc: "Our goddess Kanako Yasaka is a deity of warfare. What is less known of her is that she plans to expand her influence way beyond just faith, technology and warfare.

Unlike the other regions of Gensokyo, these mountains are filled with invaluable metals - namedly iron and copper.\nEspecially the copper of the Peony Field drew the attention of Eirin as its close proximity to the divine Myouren Temple made the copper... \"blessed\" - or at least has shown anomalies.

We also should conquer some of the other iron and copper productions too while we are at it."

They would be a massive upgrade for our army, but at the same time the morality of using said weapons is questionable at best..."

And like all the times ago, it was a one-sided love. However, this time Kaguya actually had a liking for the Emperor and befriended him. But these times were of short duration and Kaguya had to move on. As a farewell, Kaguya sent a letter to the Emperor as well as the little bit of what was left of the Hourai potion.\nKaguya never learnt of what has happened with the man until she set her foot on Mount Fuji today. She found an ancient, charred letter from her friend of the past as well as what appears to be the burned remains of the Hourai potion. The Emperor couldn't imagine an immortal life without seeing her ever again so he decided to burn the potion and a farewell letter on this place in hope the message would reach Kaguya one day."

 flavor_eit.17.t: "Marriage Declined!"
 flavor_eit.17.desc: "The ignorant leader of [From.GetName] does not acknowledge the appeal of Reisen and rejects a marriage between the rabbit and their loyal samurai servant. They claim that Reisen would be too useless for the [From.GetAdjective] rule and that an alliance with [Root.GetName] is not desirable."
 flavor_eit.17.a: "This is utterly INSULTING!"

Naturally, the bird brain misunderstood Kanako completely, and has decided to take over Gensokyo.\n\nWhile the surface is facing randomly appearing geysers and annoying spirit earths, the head of Chireiden is completely unaware of the situation.

Our good goddess Kanako granted this bird the power of nuclear fusion.\n\nHowever, Utsuho is not necessarily the brightest.
