Of course normal won battles would suffice too."

 NET_consolidate_gensokyan_trade_desc: "While Yuyuko enjoys the many cuisines of the Outworld, they still need to find their way to Gensokyo first before they can be served.

 NET_food_monopoly_title: "Cuisine Monopoly"
 NET_food_monopoly_desc: "Now that we have control over the influx of the many foods of the world to Gensokyo, we can establish a monopoly over it. No bad meal will ever reach anyone of Gensokyo as long we are here!"
 NET_conquer_fujiwara_title: "Put out the Phoenix"
 NET_conquer_fujiwara_desc: "Unlike the other realms of Gensokyo Netherworld is filled with ghosts, phantoms and spirits. Because of our unique population most of the livings try to avoid us.

Killing her is no option due to immortality, but we can force her to move away from us by taking over her part of the Bamboo Forest and using its resources for our capital."
 NET_the_yama_question_title: "Netherworld and the Yama"
 NET_the_yama_question_desc: "The Netherworld is as old as Gensokyo itself and was originally under the management of the yama. Due to the lack of resources, the yama decided to transfer this task to somebody, who lives locally within Netherworld, which at this time was none other than our good mistress Yuyuko herself.\nEver since Netherworld has been de jure a vassal of Higan. However, the grasp of the yama over the Netherworld has been dwindling. While it is good for us in the short term, mistress Yuyuko fears that this might be the first sign of the yama losing complete control over the after life.

 NET_conquer_mima_title: "Return Mima to Peace"
 NET_conquer_mima_desc: "Not all spirits managed to be kept within Hell, Former Hell or Netherworld. Some managed to find their way into the world of the living all by their own and are causing chaos out there. The most prominent ghost is Mima herself, the vengeful spirit, which even managed to defeat the goddess Shinki in the past.\nWhile we usually don't care too much about what happens in the world of the mortals, Yuyuko considers Mima to be important enough to be integrated into Netherworld's society instead of letting her continue rampaging in Gensokyo."
 NET_open_the_grand_cuisine_title: "Open the Grand Market"
 NET_open_the_grand_cuisine_desc: "Our good mistress Yuyuko Saigyouji is an enjoyer of the many exotic cuisines of the world.

Instead we have Daimyos - a bunch of vassals who think they have a free will, but are in the end our subjects. They can declare wars on their own and expand without us having to support them. That comes however with the drawback that they might grow too rapidly, which makes them think they can take at on with you. In such cases you have the option to either demand their collapse (which of course will displease them) or make them to your March. Marches are much more obedient and don't cause as much troubles, but will occupy one of your March Slots. If you have more marches than March Slots, your marches will get the choice to either revert back to daimyo - and repeat this cycle - or will declare independence war upon you. So be sure you are using your marches wisely.\nOther than that your realm is pretty easy to handle. Any questions?"

 ###MISSIONS FOR MHG###
 MHG_the_great_sages_of_gensokyo_title: "Unite the Sages"
 MHG_the_great_sages_of_gensokyo_desc: "Ever wondered how Gensokyo came into existence in the first place? I know you can't answer, so I just assume you said yes.\nAround the time when you humans started industrializing and constructing machinery you stopped your belief in the demons, supernatural creatures and ghosts. You became \"\"\"enlightened\"\"\" (well, as enlightened a human could be that is) and as such seized to believe in said creatures, the youkai. Well, that was not good for our kind so the sages of Gensokyo formed a group and created the Hakurei Barrier, closing a part of Japan off from the rest of the world, where the youkai can live in peace.\n\nI suppose you have noticed two key points here though: first, I was talking about the industrialization while here in fact you are still in like the Age of Discovery. Secondly, I noted a \"part of Japan\", and, well, your Gensokyo is considerably larger. Please don't let your immersion ruined by this contradiction. Just imagine this Gensokyo is an alternate reality.\nAnyway, where was I? Ah right, the Barrier. In this universe the barrier broke - don't ask me why. Just gather the sages together and we can start \"restoring\" it."
 MHG_collect_resources_title: "Gather the Resources"
 MHG_collect_resources_desc: "Alright, now that our little group is united again it is time to get working on the border. Or at least I would like to if it wouldn't for the little fact that we need magical resources to construct this barrier. You know, making walls isn't cheap. Would you be so nice and look for them while Okina, Kasen and I enjoy some tea? That would be very nice of you, human.\nYou will need to gather any kind of metal as they will serve as catalysts for the border creation. Cloths will serve as the the border between Gensokyo and the world while the spices keep it all together. Don't ask my why spices do this, Okina has tricks which even I can't grasp my head around them."

Okay, human, do as I say and we get our pretty blob over the continent. First, build some troops and focus on sword mana. You will need to crack some skulls.\n\nOh, right, I suppose you want some reward, don't you? Well, you can have a general version of my favourite cat, Chen. That shall do."
 MHG_hire_mercs_title: "Summon the Mercs"
 MHG_hire_mercs_desc: "You know what, I think normal soldiers don't cut it for my beloved purple blob. They take too much time to get into the action and have no special abilities other than dying in a pointless war. I think it is better that we focus on more interesting and less incompetent armies - like mercenary companies. Don't worry, they will be worth it. My boundary skills will make sure of that."
 MHG_great_merc_army_title: "The Great Merc Army"
 MHG_great_merc_army_desc: "I know we already have like three mercenary companies in our army, but I think we should double down with the mercenaries. They are quite handy and we will need more of them to fight bigger wars. Of course you can supplement them with normal troops... buuuut then you could just have picked any other country instead."
 MHG_only_the_best_merc_title: "My personal Elite Force"
 MHG_only_the_best_merc_desc: "Alright, we had mercenaries in action and even more in our army. However, I amm not quite content with them just yet. As you can see, there are many more mercenaries on the world, and those from the Outworld might have the punch needed for becoming my elite force - basically my next royal guard. \"Why?\" you ask? Well, somebody with my power wouldn't really *need* an army like that, but I like the idea of having a personal royal guard.\nAnyway, to form such prestigious contiment I need some test mercenaries who could fulfil this role. Would you be so kind and recruit four foreign companies and get the army tradition up?"
 MHG_might_of_the_gap_hag_title: "The Puppet Master"
 MHG_might_of_the_gap_hag_desc: "While fighting wars can be quite exciting, it is also a very exhausting job. You need to carpet siege your enemies, make sure you don't run out of manpower, your pesky peasants complain about \"War Exhaustion\" and all that stuff. Don't you think it would be much nicer to have a subject - or a LOT of subjects - do the heavy lift instead? Just make sure that this government reform mana goes up and I will give you some nice reform."
 MHG_insult_the_moon_people_title: "Insult the Moon People"
 MHG_insult_the_moon_people_desc: "A long time ago I lead youkais into a war against the lunarians. It was... quite the experience for both parties: dead piles of rabbit bodies for the lunarians and mass youkai graves for my side. In the end, the youkais begged to me to end this campaign and call for a truce with the lunarians, which they begrudgingly agreed on to.\nWhat I didn't tell to these youkais is that I never made official peace with the lunarians. To this day, Gensokyo is still at war with them on paper. Come! Let us remind these pesky lunarians that they are still just filth!"
 MHG_annihilate_the_lunarians_title: "Annihilate the Lunarians"
 MHG_annihilate_the_lunarians_desc: "There is a secret I need to tell you: I never ordered an invasion of the moon for any personal power gain, or to eradicate the lunarians, but to teach the youkais the misdeeds of war. *Sigh* Considering the state of Gensokyo in this game though, it seems like I have failed, and trying to teach these infidels won't suffice.\nMight be better to embrace the chaos and bloodlust, don't you think? Let us annihilate them like the pest they are!"
 MHG_annihilate_the_lunarians_at: "We have won a war against §Y[LEM.GetName]§! in the last §Y20 years§! without having suffered a defeat ourselves by [LEM.GetName] in the last §Y20 years§!."

 MHG_the_spies_of_yukari_title: "Expand Spy Network"
 MHG_the_spies_of_yukari_desc: "There are not many espionage countries in Gensokyo. You could argue that the tengus are spies, but they lack morales in any other kind too, so that doesn't count. Because of that, Mayohiga, this beautiful purple blob, has the role of being the spy master of Gensokyo. But that can't go anywhere if our spynetwork is still so pathetic. Sooo... get spying now!"
 MHG_daimyo_collector_title: "The Great Puppeteer"

 ###MISSIONS FOR MRY###
 MRY_religious_prestige_title: "Moriya Prestige"

 MRY_religious_treasury_title: "Invest in the Shrine"
 MRY_religious_treasury_desc: "Our dear goddess, Yasaka Kanako, noted that the Moriya Shrine, while being at the perfect location, is nowhere near to be ready for getting mass visit.

 MRY_danmaku_barracks_title: "Danmaku Training Fields"
 MRY_danmaku_barracks_desc: "The Moriya Clan arrived in Gensokyo in peace. However, Gensokyo is very much not in the mood for it - youkai races to arms, vampires are trying to conquer the south and a heretic goddess in the north expands her influence. If we want to survive in this harsh environment we will need troops and proper training in the arts of Danmaku fights. Additional Danamku training fields will be required though."
 MRY_danmaku_fights_title: "Fight the Leaders"
 MRY_danmaku_fights_desc: "Having a huge army fighting wars for one is one way to solve conflict, but it is not the only one. Our good shrine maiden Sanae needs to learn how to fight on a personal level. It would be best if she practices it against the other danmaku masters in Gensokyo"
 MRY_reform_the_shrine_title: "Enact Shrine Laws"
 MRY_reform_the_shrine_desc: "The Moriya Clan is yet only a shrine theocracy.

 MRY_moriya_festival_title: "Wonders of a New World"
 MRY_moriya_festival_desc: "While Kanako enjoys using the shrine spies to her liking, the other goddess Suwako Moriya wishes for something out of the ordinary: the preperations to discover a world which is even more foreign than Gensokyo is to us. A \"New World\" in the west.\nOr at least she wishes us to have this possibility to go after it. In the end, she does not care if we go a path or not, she cares that we have a path open in the first place."
 MRY_army_quality_title: "Improve Army Quality"
 MRY_army_quality_desc: "The Hakurei Clan basques in their stories of hunting powerful youkais down and winning battles against all odds.

 MRY_suwako_organizing_title: "Expand the Bureaucracy"
 MRY_suwako_organizing_desc: "Suwako has expressed yet again a wish. This time it is about the bureaucracy of the Moriya Shrine - or rather its lack of.

 MRY_abundance_of_mana_title: "Abundance of Faith"
 MRY_abundance_of_mana_desc: "The best way of measuring a Gensokyan theocracy's efficiency is by spectating its monthly mana and faith income. Both Kanako and Suwako have sworn that if our realm gains an abundance of faith they will bless our donation box personally."
 MRY_miracle_worker_title: "Miracle Worker"
 MRY_miracle_worker_desc: "Our mistress Sanae is famous for her ability to cause miracles. But there are still non-believers who deny her abilities. They shall see the power of Sanae's abilities first hand!"
