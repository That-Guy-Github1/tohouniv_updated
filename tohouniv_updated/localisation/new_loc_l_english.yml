Luckily for us, the Moon and Gensokyo had undergone a massive transformation, this sage no longer had any influence on the Moon, and we were finally able to take the Lunar Capital.\n\nHowever, this cunning sage may have devised some evil wisdom to undo our victory, and she may be harboring Chang'e, who has fled from the Moon, just as she fled to Earth with her princess.

 JNK_integrate_clownpiecia_title: "Hell Fairy Clownpiece"
 JNK_integrate_clownpiecia_desc: "Clownpiece is a subordinate of Junko's friend Hecatia, and brilliant fairy who played a key role in Junko's invasion of the Moon.

But now that the Moon is fully in our hands, her ability also has risk to shake the hard-won peace, so it seems necessary to bring her into our court and control her powers.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that her contributions are ignored.

Her and Junko's vengeance will not stop until they capture Chang'e, but in order to pursue Junko beyond the Moon, they both need to take on more work.

 JNK_entrance_of_china_title: "Entrance of China"
 JNK_entrance_of_china_desc: "One of the places Chang'e is very likely to have fled is the continent of China, her and Junko's old home. According to the records left behind by Lunarians as they watch over the earth, the dynasty that currently rules China is a much larger nation than nations of ages which Junko remembers, but is quite corrupt within. And they has been sensitive to foreign invasions, so subjugated many of their neighbors.\n\nIf this account is true, sending our forces into China to search for the elusive Chang'e is very likely to provoke them. Fortunately, Lunarian's records indicate that the current Chinese dynasty is not in control of their northern border well. Especially as the tribes to the northeast of China are unable to band together as a single force and are under the loose control of the Chinese dynasty. If we can penetrate this soft spot, we may be able to secure an entrance into China."
 JNK_domination_of_china_title: "Back into China"

 JNK_protect_china_title: "Protect Border of China"
 JNK_protect_china_desc: "Another challenge to being recognized as China's ruler is protecting the country's borders from outside forces. While Manchuria is already subservient to us, nomadic tribes to the northwest, including the Mongols, have taken advantage of China's shifting masters to plunder the border. To deal with these problems, Chinese dynasties have tried to fortify their northern borders to keep out foreign invasions. If Junko is to be recognized as the new ruler, she will need to fortify and protect China's borders just like them - or unlike them."
 JNK_unify_china_title: "Unify China"
 JNK_unify_china_desc: "All that remains for us now is to fully restore the territory of China. We have subdued the dynasties of China, but not the warlords of the continent and the former subjects of China.

 JNK_recover_silkroad_desc: "Chinese people valued commerce as much as agriculture, and the silk roads they built over the centuries brought immense wealth to the land by trading China's bounty of goods. But like the ground, whenever there was turmoil in China, these roads would fall into disrepair, falling prey to greedy warlords and nomads. We need to restore the silk roads to restore China's wealth, and we need to take control and use that wealth useful."

 JNK_conquer_heaven_title: "Search Dragon Palace"
 JNK_conquer_heaven_desc: "To find the Chang'e who fled from the Moon, we'll need to start with the region closest to the Moon. The Heavenly realm, located between Gensokyo and the Moon, has maintained a loose relationship with the Lunar Capital, and is inhabited by Celestials who are just as arrogant, if not more so, than the Lunarians. We need to scour the Heavenly realm to track Chang'e's whereabouts."
 JNK_enter_the_gensokyo_title: "Enter the Gensokyo"
 JNK_enter_the_gensokyo_desc: "While there was no sign of Chang'e in the Heavenly Realm, our investigations in the Heavenly Realm led us to a possible location where Chang'e might have headed. A prime candidate is an area not too far from the Heavenly Realm, in the northern part of Gensokyo, where evil spirits congregate. This area, with its many strong auras emanating from the spirits, would be an easy place for Chang'e to hide her presence felt. Let's teach these evil spirits how the fear of true grudge!"
 JNK_people_worship_goddess_title: "People who Worship Goddess"
 JNK_people_worship_goddess_desc: "We have been unsuccessful in finding any trace of Chang'e amongst the intense evil spirit energy, and Junko has set her sights on the human's residences beyond the spirit lands. The humans on the surface worship several beings in Gensokyo as goddesses, and Chang'e was once a goddess herself. It is possible that Chang'e is disguising herself as a goddess to the humans and using their faith to gather strength to escape from us forever. Let's take control of the center of the humans' faith, and teach them who their true goddess is."
 JNK_search_pandemonium_title: "Capital of Demon Realm"
 JNK_search_pandemonium_desc: "To the west of human residences lies the country of demons and the goddesses who created them. The capital of this country, called the Makai, is known for its various magical developments, and many demons and gods are said to come and go. This area is also the entrance to the outside world from Gensokyo. The possibility of Chang'e escaping to the outworld through this place should not be missed.

Although they came to Gensokyo from Japan, not from ancient China like Junko, the teachings they practice are derived from ancient Chinese thought, a religion called Taoism in Japan. And Chang'e, like Junko, is one of the survivors of ancient China. Perhaps Chang'e has infiltrated this group and is lording it over them. You must subdue them and discover Chang'e's whereabouts."

 JNK_discover_indonesia_title: "Beyond the Barrier"
 JNK_discover_indonesia_desc: "While we've been preoccupied with invading the Lunar Capital, the Moon and Gensokyo have undergone a massive change. The Hakurei barrier has become unexpectedly weak and has failed to fulfill its role as a barrier to the outworld. Crafty Chang'e must have taken advantage of this and fled the Moon. We must dispatch a fleet to search the area around the moon, Gensokyo, and even the oceans of the outworld for any place Chang'e might have fled to."
 JNK_search_indonesia_title: "Volcano of Goddess"
 JNK_search_indonesia_desc: "Chang'e has long been worshipped as a moon goddess by the humans of earth, so it is very likely that she has fled to an area where the humans worship the moon goddess in order to gain the strength to escape from us. Our fleet's research indicates that there are many islands beyond the sea south of China, and one of them has a volcano associated with the moon goddess worshipped by the earthlings. We should send troops to search the area and look for signs of Chang'e."
 JNK_search_india_title: "Search the Land of Gods"
 JNK_search_india_desc: "While our search for Chang'e on the Goddess Volcano was unsuccessful, we were able to learn more about the religion practiced by the inhabitants of volcano and its surroundings. The religion they practice is one that spread from a large subcontinent to the west of these islands, and it is said that the region worships several gods in addition to the moon god, and that temples dedicated to them abound. If this is true, it is likely that Chang'e fled to that subcontinent for gathering their faith. Let's send an army west to search for the temples of these earthlings."
 JNK_search_egypt_title: "Needle in a Sandstack"
 JNK_search_egypt_desc: "Even in the Land of the Gods, we fail to find Chang'e, and we receive only vague information that there is no longer a religion that worships the god of the moon in the lands beyond this subcontinent. However, through our diligent research, we are able to discover that there is a region in the desert lands beyond the subcontinent that once worshiped the god of the moon. While this religion is now extinct, its facilities are said to still exist beneath there scorching desert.

And among her kin are three goddesses who preside over vengeance.\n\nAccording to Hecatia, the goddesses of vengeance can to find the sinner Chang'e.
