 th_danmaku_event.1.t: "Danmaku Fights"
 th_danmaku_event.1.desc: "Because this is your first Incident, I will explain how it works: Incidents are a chain of events, which impact large areas of Gensokyo, your realm and the characters, which are involved in this mess - your ruler is among them. \nDuring the Incident your ruler will make a journey through Gensokyo and encounter special foes: the Stage Bosses from the original Touhou games. To progress the Incident storyline you'll have to find a way to pass these Bosses. The most common way for this is the traditional \"Danmaku Fight\" between your ruler and your opponent. The combat skills of your foe are fixed, but the skills of your ruler are determined by these stats:\n - Military Skill of your ruler * 100\n - Army Tradition * 3\n - Religious Unity * 0.5\n - Tolerance of the True Faith * 100\n - Danmaku Power\n - Multiplied by your Danmaku Power Modifier + 100%\n\nIf your fighting skill outdoes the skill of your opponent, you will most likely win. Victories increase \"points\" for a positive ending of the Incident, while defeats decrease them. The decisions you make in random Incident events affect these points too. When all Stage Bosses are cleared you'll get an ending event and, if the score is high enough, gain a powerful modifier."

 th_danmaku_event.4.t: "Draw"

One day you come along to a \"Wanted Sign\", but instead of a criminal it is an investigator wanted! It appears that the former investigator may have been killed and the people of Gensokyo don't know who should continue the investigations. Maybe you, [Root.Monarch.GetName], can grab this chance to earn the glory of somebody, who saved Gensokyo from the Incident..."
 th_incidents_event.11.a: "I have my own reasons why I want this incident done. I will be the new investigator!"
 th_incidents_event.11.a.tt: "Your ruler becomes the new investigator and continues to fight the current incident!"
 th_incidents_event.11.b: "I am sorry, but I don't have the time to solve this incident."

 th_danmaku_event.20.t: "Diplomatically Danmaku Fights"
 th_danmaku_event.20.desc: "Sometimes two friends are arguing with each other or want to do a Danmaku Fight without the threat of anybody getting killed. In those cases the \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\", also known as a \"Friendly Danmaku Fight\" or short \"DDF\" or rather \"FDF\", will be used instead of the traditional Danmaku Fight. The \"combat\" skills of your foe are fixed, but the skills of your ruler are determined by these stats:\n - +50 points, because a ruler without SOME diplomatic skills is not a ruler\n - Diplomatic Skill of your ruler * 100\n - Prestige * 3\n - The Number of Subjects * 50\n - Diplomatic Reputation * 100\n - Danmaku Power\n - Multiplied by your Danmaku Power Modifier + 100%\n\nIf your diplomatic skill outdoes the skill of your opponent, you will most likely win.

 th_danmaku_event.20.a: "Thanks for the information."
 th_danmaku_event.21.t: "Major Victory"
 th_danmaku_event.21.desc: "It was a short argument and you easily convinced your opponent for your case without the need to shoot any danmaku missiles, which means you get not only the normal winner prize but also the money for the usual repair costs."
 th_danmaku_event.21.a: "And they say Charisma isn't worth skilling."
 th_danmaku_event.22.t: "Victory"
 th_danmaku_event.22.desc: "Your arguments were solid and your missiles hit the mark perfectly. It didn't take long before your opponent capitulated before your diplomatic (and fighting) skills."
 th_danmaku_event.22.a: "Speak soft words and big sticks can bring one far."
 th_danmaku_event.23.t: "Draw"
 th_danmaku_event.23.desc: "A long and grindy argument was going on, but neither one could convince the other one with either the arguments or the missiles. In the end you and your opponent settled for a draw. Luckily your opponent has a little too much money and decided to take over the repair costs."
 th_danmaku_event.23.a: "Well, at least I didn't lose money."
 th_danmaku_event.24.t: "Defeat"
 th_danmaku_event.24.desc: "You tried to convince your opponent, but all of your arguments were baseless and your opponent made a good point. In the end you decided to let the argument be before some missiles fly so you have only to pay your penalty."

 th_danmaku_event.25.t: "Major Defeat"
 th_danmaku_event.25.desc: "Your opponents arguments weren't not only better but also at provoking.

Because of her sun sensitive skin she has to remain in the great halls of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. But one day she decided that her freedom of movement was limited for too long and she released the Scarlet Mist, a magical red fog, which blocks any sunlight. And even though Remilia will attract many adventurers and self-proclaimed investigators, who seek to stop her, she enjoys every single second of this incident. The eternal, scarlet night is a beautiful sight after all..."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.400.desc.2: "During a peaceful summer in Gensokyo, an unnatural scarlet mist appears without warning and covers much of the land. It is strong enough to block out the sun, causing the affected areas to become dark and cold. The inhabitants of Gensokyo are worried, that the sun might be gone forever and now they are seeking the help of the shrine maiden to end the spreading of this unnatural fog..."

As you follow this pattern you see in the distance a complete black sphere flying aimlessly - and it just bumps into a tree.\nYou are approaching the crash spot and find a dizzy girl. This girl is Rumia, the youkai of darkness. Rumia doesn't want you to continue your search until she is fed - and she wants to eat you! She doesn't seem that big of a threat though and could just be ignored because of her dizziness, but with her around, there's not enough light to find the way to the lake, so you might as well put an end to her nighttime snack craving."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.a: "She's in my way! I'll have to fight her, if I want to find the source of the mist."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Rumia and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!\nThe chances for a victory depend on your §YRuler's Military Skill§!, your §YArmy Tradition§!, your §YReligious Unity§! and your §YTolerance of the True Faith§!. §YDanmaku Power§! increases your ruler's power by a fixed amount and §YDanmaku Power Modifier + 100%§! increases your chances prozentually.\n\nBe cautious though: even the most powerful warriors can lose the easiest fights!

 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.c: "My allies can deal with her."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.c.tt: "You will send Rumia to one of your allies to deal with her. While it gives you a minor bonus for a positive ending, your allies won't be too happy with Rumia and you. If you get unlucky this may even backfire..."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.d: "She's just a nuisance and will go eventually."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.2.d.tt: "You will try to ignore her presence. She won't harm you, yet she will annoy you and slows your progress down, resulting in a minor malus for a positive ending of the Incident."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.t: "Cirno, Ice Fairy of the Lake"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.desc: "After you passed Rumia, you finally managed to reach the Misty Lake. A magical fog completely covers the lake and you have trouble to see through it. Hours have passed on the lake and you become unsure where you are. Suddenly you hear a voice: \"When you lose your way, it's because of the fairies!\"\nYou see two fairies approaching you - a green haired one and a smaller, blue haired one. While the greenhead doesn't seem to want to bother you, the bluehead actively tries to block you on your path.\nHer name is Cirno, \"the Strongest\", and wants you to show who's the boss of this lake. You'll never find the culprit with this obstruction around, so why not brave a hailstorm or two? Her specialty is ice and freezing magic, so she's someone who'd be pretty useful on a hot summer day."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.a: "Well, if she's responsible for this fog, I'll have to blow her and her fog away!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Cirno and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.b: "I don't have time for this! Annoy someone else!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.b.tt: "You skip the fight and send Cirno in a random direction away from you - with the promise to freeze fun stuff. While it allows you to make progress, you sent her (unfortunately) to your realm, where she creates chaos and results in decreasing your progress. At the end, you will gain a minor bonus for a positive ending (and a lot of frozen frogs in your realm)."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.c: "Cirno... just go back to your realm."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.c.tt: "You send Cirno back to her realm and as your vassal she obeys. Even though she isn't too happy about the fact that she isn't the boss of the lake anymore."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.d: "Ok, listen up you little fairy..."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.d.tt: "You try to trick Cirno into dissolving the fog she created..."

 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.d.fail: "... and your trick fails, because she is too stupid to fall for it."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.e: "I will shake Cirno off in the fog."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.3.e.tt: "You try to flee from the annoyance and get stuck even more in the fog. While she won't bother you anymore, you will lose time in the fog. But at least you have time to rethink your ruling strategies..."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.t: "Hong Meiling, Chinese Girl"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.desc: "As the fog faded and the path became clear, you eventually reached the center of this Scarlet Mist: a large mansion in the middle on a little island. As you were looking how to enter a house of the scale of a town you encounter a young woman with long red hair in front of a gate. She reveals herself to be the gatekeeper Hong Meiling and the outer door guard of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and does her job with flair. A youkai wielding rainbow magic and an interesting dash, she stands between you and the center of the mist. But while she takes her job seriously, she also takes a break after some hours."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.a: "Well, this Incident can't wait any further. I'll probably have to punch my way through."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.a.tt: "§YThis will trigger a fight between Meiling and [Root.Monarch.GetName]!§!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.d: "At the wish of the Celestial Emperor, I demand you to let me pass!"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.d.tt: "Meiling is skeptical about your demand, but you show her your Celestial Seal. She has never seen nor heard of a Celestial Seal, but she recognizes the symbols on the seal and lets you through nonetheless."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.e: "I could sneak past her when she's doing her break again."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.4.e.tt: "You skip the fight and wait for Meiling to take a break. Hours and hours are passing, but finally Meiling takes a nap and you can pass her. But the time you've been waiting and observing her wasn't very productive."
 th_incidents_scarletmists.5.t: "Patchouli Knowledge, the Girl of Knowledge and Shade"
 th_incidents_scarletmists.5.desc: "After you've passed the gatekeeper, you stumble into a large library. A very good friend you know would fall in love with this place immediately and take all these books. While you grin about the image of said friend with a tower of books in arms, you encounter a devil girl and, while she didn't pose a threat, she did make a lot of noise in your fight with her.\nA few moments later a voice echoes through the library: \"You, the red-white one! There is no rampaging around in my study.\" A woman with long, purple hair and a outfit, which looks more like something you would wear in bed than in a library, approaches you. This woman, Patchouli Knowledge, is the librarian of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. As the guardian of the books in the library, she stops you as you try to find the cause of all this mist.

As you begin to think you're lost in this mansion you notice some fairies flying around. They are dressed as maids and carry all kinds of cleaning tools. You even witness how two fairies, their sight completely blocked by their large brooms they carry, crash into each other. All of a sudden you hear an angered voice: \"Ah, the cleaning isn't getting anywhere! The mistress will be angry with me!!\" An elegant looking maid with silver hair appears. She is the mysterious chief maid Sakuya Izayoi and looks like a normal human, but don't be fooled: with her astonishing ability to control time and her remarkable skill with knives, she truly is a dangerous opponent - and she won't let any intruder get to her mistress."

Sakuya then leaves you alone and the doors behind you close. The figure rises from the throne and approaches you - and when the shadows around shrink you can see the true person: a young looking girl with light-blue hair, red eyes and large, black, bat-like wings on her back. She reveals herself as the master of the house and the vampire Remilia Scarlet. She is the cause of all the Scarlet Mist that has been hanging around Gensokyo. Although she appears young, she is in fact over 500 years of age, and claims to be a descendant of Tepes himself. While her origin may be a lie, her goal to spread the mist is not. It will take a tough fight to end her plans."

Arriving in the basement you see a little girl with short, blonde hair, red eyes and wings with colorful crystals. She reveals herself as Flandre Scarlet, Remilia's younger sister. Having lived alone in a basement for 495 years, the commotion of recent events drew her attention. Flandre is only 5 years younger than her sister, but possesses far greater power. All alone, deep underground, it's hard to say that this is a blessing rather than a curse. Regardless, she now wants to play danmaku with you and won't hold back."

Still, you don't want a powerful vampire walking in the shrine and try to convince her to leave. Then suddenly, you hear a loud, intimidating thunder - pretty unusual for this time of the year. As your guest and you look outside, you find a large, dark cloud over the shrine. As soon as Remilia leaves the building, the cloud starts raining. Because of the vampire's weakness to stay in flowing water like rain, Remilia is forced to stay a little bit longer in the shrine - to your discomfort.

Just like Remilia, Flandre turns out to be a kind hearted and friendly person, who is really curious about the world outside the mansion. And Remilia doesn't seem to be mad about her defeat at all.

Somebody put an imitation in its place and covered the original moon up! As long as this fake moon stands, the masses of weak youkai have troubles to keep their sanity.

 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.17.desc: "Ever since the Moriya Shrine declared their intention to unite Gensokyo religiously, many of their missionaries wandered through Gensokyo and converted random provinces. This time, one of those pesky shrine maidens has found interests for [Root.GetName]! While the damage is already done it is not too late to send our own shrine maidens to bring the locales back to the right path!"

 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.18.t: "The Schemes of Kanako"
 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.18.desc: "The Moriya Shrine originates from the Outside World at the beginning, but due to the human faith in gods like Kanako waning, she decided to relocate the shrine to Gensokyo against Suwako's will. Even though she lost power to technology in the past, she still remain fascinated at it and has planned to revolutionize the life standard in Gensokyo.\nTo achieve this goal, Kanako worked out a scheme: the first step is creating their own branch of Shintoism, which is more focused on the deities of the Moriya Shrine. The second step is spreading this faith and eliminating all rivals, which eventually leads to the Mountain of Faith Incident. While the chaos is ongoing her next step is to increase the power of hell raven, which eventually should be the energy source for this modernization attempt.\n\nLittle did Kanako know that with these actions she set a chain of event in motions, which will change Gensokyo forever..."

 th_incidents_mountainoffaith.20.desc: "Ever since the Shrine started spreading their faith to all of Gensokyo, our Moriya vassal has become quite rebellious. However, the worst of their behaviour wasn't reached yet: the Moriya deities refused to send any troops for our case, sabotaged our efforts to keep religious unity in the realm and even started acting independent!"

However, not all of the new followers are free to pray to Kanako and live their new religion out. To solve this problem, Kanako worked out a 10 Point List, which should even convince the most stubborn rulers to convert to Moriya Shintoism."

Their result: the Counter Reformation!\nEvery realm, which seeks to end the issues caused by the heretic reformation may have the option to contact the shrine maidens of the counter reformation to purge these Moriya troublemakers."

Despite any kind of efforts, the shrine just seems to never get any human visitors. And when humans visit they never donate, which is everything but common for Shinto shrines. It's even the opposite! The shrine seems even LOSE donations - as if the donation box itself is cursed!\nMany speculate that the curse is due to Reimu's lazy attitude of praising to the Hakurei deity and that the Hakurei God is not pleased at Reimu at all..."

 th_cursed_donation_box.16.desc: "It is said that there are no rules in love and war - especially when the common soldier is not sure if they will get their earnings when their realm is going through a financial crisis. Because of these circumstances many of our troops started looting and pillaging the provinces of our enemies and throw all of their disciplined manners out of the window for more gold.\nOn the flip side: because of their newly acquired behaviour we are now justified to pay them less and let them loose on the enemies civilians."

 TH_lunarian_events.1.desc: "You find a dusty crate. You are not sure what this crate contains, but it sure looks like it has been around for a long time. As you open the crate in your chambers, you cannot believe what you have found: a bunch of maps back from the times when the Moon was under attack from the youkai of Earth! Those maps describe a landmass known as Gensokyo! With those maps and Lunarian spies you have a good understanding of what is going on in Gensokyo!"
 TH_lunarian_events.1.a: "Interesting."
 TH_lunarian_events.8.t: "Lunarian Threat"
 TH_lunarian_events.8.desc: "The Lunarian are a powerful species, who are masters in art, religion, magic and technology. Because of our superiority in every shape and form we won the war against the invading youkai hundreds of years ago. However, even after all these years, our names are marked in the memories of the Earthlings. Should we ever attack Gensokyo in the near future everyone will try to focus on us!"

 TH_lunarian_events.9.desc: "Around a thousand years ago, Yukari Yakumo and her youkai lackeys tried to invade the moon to steal magic and technology of the Moon and to slaughter the Lunarians. It was a brutal war, which took the lives of thousands of moon rabbit servants, but in the end, the Lunarians managed to drive Yukari back to Earth. The war has been over for a long time, but its effects on the Lunarian society are still noticeable to this day. The Lunarian army built a massive defensive system for the Moon for the case that any Gensokyan should ever invade the Moon. Those defenses are still intact and will crush any invading force, which is foolish enough to attack the Moon."
 TH_lunarian_events.9.a: "Ok."

 TH_lunarian_events.11.t: "Lunar Defenses get deactivated"
 TH_lunarian_events.11.desc: "The war against the puny Earthlings is over. Regardless of the outcome, the defense systems of the Moon get deactivated now until they dare to attack again!"
 TH_lunarian_events.11.a: "Hopefully they learned their lesson now."
 TH_lunarian_events.12.t: "Lunar Defenses are outdated!"
 TH_lunarian_events.12.desc: "The Lunar Defense Systems protected the Moon from Earth threats for a long time. But with the years the Earthlings managed to catch up with technology and magic and created weapons and armors, which can nullify the Defense System!"
 TH_lunarian_events.12.a: "Not the best news..."
 TH_lunarian_events.12.tt: "The Moon is open for any invasion by the Earthlings!"

 ###HKR EVENTS###
 flavor_hkr.2.t: "The many supporters of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_hkr.2.desc: "Reimu made many friends over the years, most of them through solving the incidents. Of course these friends are ready to help Reimu in times of need, but sadly, Reimu's abilities to handle them all is limited - like right now. If she wants to take the full advantage of the support, she has to decide whose help she can keep."
 flavor_hkr.2.a: "Remilia, I let you go back to the mansion."
 flavor_hkr.2.b: "Yuyuko, Netherworld is calling for you again."

 flavor_hkr.3.a.tt:0 "Every [Root.Religion.GetName] nation who is not allied to [HVR.GetName] will have an increased opinion of §G100§! to us."
 flavor_hkr.4.t: "Suika returns!"
 flavor_hkr.4.desc: "A whole week has passed and Suika is yet again at the Hakurei Shrine: this time even with proof that she truly was in Hell (she shows Eiki's stamp on her hand) and Heaven (she holds a torn out piece of Tenshi's clothes) and now she wishes for the sake. Reimu gives her the sake reluctantly and after a while, Suika becomes completely drunk...\nThe next morning, more chaos can be found at the shrine. As an apology, Suika offers her service for the [Root.GovernmentName]."
 flavor_hkr.4.a: "Well, her powers could be quite useful at the front."
 flavor_hkr.4.a.tt: "Suika Ibuki will become a general for our realm, which can be recruited every 30 - 60 years."
 flavor_hkr.4.b: "She could teach the other shrine maidens of how to fight in melee combat."
 flavor_hkr.4.b.tt: "Suika will remain in the training fields and won't be a general in our service."
 flavor_hkr.5.t: "A horned Shrine Maiden"
 flavor_hkr.5.desc: "Suika has been a long resident of the Hakurei Shrine for quite some time. Due to this, she enjoys a high trust from Reimu.\nWhile Reimu is a competent shrine maiden, she knows that her days are limited due to being a mortal so she is considering declaring Suika to the official heir of [Root.GetName]..."
 flavor_hkr.5.a: "On the other hand, I think it's not a great idea."
 flavor_hkr.5.a.tt: "Suika will remain to be only a resident of the Hakurei Shrine."
 flavor_hkr.5.b: "You will make a great apprentice, Suika."
 flavor_hkr.5.c: "You know what, I am in an age for retirement anyway."
 flavor_hkr.6.t: "Suika the Oni Miko"
 flavor_hkr.6.desc: "The time has come! Reimu has decided to retire and let the new Oni Shrine Maiden - Suika Ibuki - become the next shrine maiden! These are exciting news as never before was the Hakurei Shrine lead by somebody other than a human!\n\nUnlike Reimu, Suika is an oni, who honors strength, loyalty and honesty. Because of this reason, the last thing an oni would do would be ignoring a Call to Arms or an invasion from the outworld!"
 flavor_hkr.6.a: "Long live Suika!"
 flavor_hkr.6.a.tt: "Suika will no longer help the army as a general or as a trainer.\n\n§TSuika Ibuki is a ruler of honesty. In case of refusing a Call to Arms, Suika will perform suboptimally as a ruler for some time.§!"
 flavor_hkr.7.t: "Wounded Oni Honor!"
 flavor_hkr.7.desc: "For an oni nothing is holier than strength and honesty - especially the latter, which brings Suika to a dilemma as she had to refuse a call to arms. Something, which no oni would allow themselves to ever do! Due to this Suika is suffering quite a heavy burden on her shoulders until enough time has passed for her to forget."
 flavor_hkr.7.a: "Dishonorable..."
 flavor_hkr.8.t: "Weaponized Poverty"
 flavor_hkr.8.desc: "It was not easy but after some convincing, Reimu managed to send Shion to our rival to pay them a little visit. Just how our Shrine Maiden expected, Shion's presence caused for a massive financial crisis in there!\nHowever, Shion noted that she prefers to not be used like that in the future and wants to help us by making loan sharks go bankrupt instead."
 flavor_hkr.8.a: "Don't forget the normal bank neither, Shion."
 flavor_hkr.9.t: "Shion's Visit"
 flavor_hkr.9.desc: "Usually it is a good sign when a god visits the throne of a country. But not today! [Root.Monarch.GetName] must have gotten the unluckiest day in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life: Shion Yorigami, the Goddess of Poverty, crashed into the court and through that a crack in the treasury has been caused. Through that a lot of our Ducats vanished into oblivion!"
 flavor_hkr.9.a: "Accursed goddess..."
 flavor_hkr.9.a.tt: "Luckily [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a wise ruler and had hired a guard, who keeps an eye on the vault of the treasury. When the Shion incident happened, the guard noticed where our precious gold went and collected it all for our realm. Because of that he gets a gift of 10 Ducats."
 flavor_hkr.102.t: "Reimu and the Incidents"
 flavor_hkr.102.desc: "Reimu Hakurei is technically just a normal human girl - she might have some strange, magical powers and the job of shrine maiden, but she is still a normal girl. However, due to her importance in Gensokyo's history, the Hakurei deity decided to transfer some of its powers to Reimu to ensure that her life will be long enough to take care of the many incidents Gensokyo will see in the future."
 flavor_hkr.102.a: "I will do my best."
 flavor_hkr.102.a.tt: "§YReimu is Immortal until the final incident is solved§!."
 flavor_hkr.103.t: "Reimu retires"
 flavor_hkr.103.desc: "With the resolvement of the final incident, the powers, which were given by the Hakurei deity, faded away - and Reimu reached a considerably high age...\nHowever, Reimu will not die to age. Instead, she is planning to retire and call it a death so everyone in Gensokyo would let her alone."
 flavor_hkr.103.a: "I sure as hell deserve retirement."
 flavor_hkr.10.t: "Punishment of a Celestial"
 flavor_hkr.10.desc: "Celestials are, in general, peaceful people who enjoy a life without any worries in Heaven and tend to be quite humble. However, Tenshi is the big exception: she is regularly bored of Heaven and travels down to Gensokyo to cause chaos and destruction - just for her pure enjoyment.\nHowever, this finally found its end as Suika traveled to Heaven and had her fun with Tenshi. As a result of this many Gensokyans are more than happy that finally someone brought justice upon Tenshi."
 flavor_hkr.10.a: "I just hope Tenshi really saw this as a punishment..."
 flavor_hkr.10.a.tt: "Every Gensokyan Hakurei Shinto nation, who is not allied with [HVR.GetName], will have increased opinion of us of §G+100§!."
 flavor_hkr.11.t: "The Barrier Team"
 flavor_hkr.11.desc: "Yukari Yakumo and Reimu Hakurei were both the protagonists during the Eternal Night Incident for Gensokyo and helped resolving the Fake Moon Issue. Unlike Marisa and Reimu, Yukari and Reimu are however no friends. However, they respect each other and sometimes even see each other as family (the truthfulness of this is however debatable). As a result of this it was not a big problem for Yukari's people to be integrated into the society of [Root.GetName]."
 flavor_hkr.11.a: "Hopefully they don't cause chaos."
 flavor_hkr.12.t: "Sake gift of the Shrine Maidens"
 flavor_hkr.12.desc: "The clergy of our realm came today to Reimu and gave her the highest quality sake possible in Gensokyo as well as the secret of producing it as a thank-you-gift for resolving the estate conflict."
 flavor_hkr.12.a: "Very nice of them!"
 th_hkr_sake_production_tt: "This gift will most likely attract sake loving oni in the future..."
 flavor_hkr.13.t: "Lifting of a Curse"
 flavor_hkr.13.desc: "Nobody knows who it is nor how it looks like, but the Hakurei God is one of the strongest yet mysterious one of all of Gensokyo and its wrath is feared. Our realm was relatively lucky as the only curse was the Donation Box - and this curse finds finally today its end! The Hakurei God is finally approving Reimu and our realm and lifts the curse of us!"
 flavor_hkr.13.a: "Today is a great day!"

 flavor_hkr.14.t: "The Eternal Gift"
 flavor_hkr.14.desc: "The day has come! The many preparations are made, the Curse of the Donation Box has been broken, the Heresy of Gensokyo has been eliminated and our [Root.GovernmentName] enjoys a time of tranquility and peace! Due to this, the gift was not surprising, but still overwhelming: the Hakurei God gave a portion of its power to Reimu Hakurei and granted her immortality! However, the job of a shrine maiden is tiring and Reimu could deserve retirement - but in the end it's her decision."
 flavor_hkr.14.a: "Well, I don't give up this job that easily!"
 flavor_hkr.14.b: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] could use some of my new powers."
 flavor_hkr.14.c: "[Root.GetName] shall remain eternal!"
 flavor_hkr.14.d: "I deserve a peaceful retirement."
 flavor_hkr.15.t: "A Miko and a Samurai"
 flavor_hkr.15.desc: "Long before the Hakurei Reformation and the invention of the Danmaku Combat System, the Hakurei Shrine was originally in the northern part of Gensokyo. During this time a young female samurai called Meira challenged Reimu to an honorable duel. Reimu defeated her quite easily, but she developed certain ... feelings towards Meira and vice versa. However, due to the movement of the shrine and the Hakurei Reformation, the contact between those two broke up. Meira remained in the Old Hakurei Shrine to maintain the traditions while Reimu lives on in the South.\nBut now, that the Old Hakurei Shrine is reclaimed by Reimu, she and Meira had again contact - and with that the emotions might have been revived too..."
 flavor_hkr.15.a: "Well, I do kinda like her..."

However, even as friends, there are certain things which bring rivalry in their friendship, especially when Incidents become a question. Even though they are friends, they always try to outdo each other and prove themselves as more powerful. While this competition is friendly in nature, it could become one day a problem if one of the two girls starts preying on the other for glory.

However, over the centuries the humans developed and built kingdoms and civilizations on their own and the balance of this relationship was threatened. To avoid complete extinction, the powerful youkai Yukari Yakumo and other youkai sages created a continent called \"Gensokyo\", which shall be home to the youkai. However, the youkai needed the emotions and faith of humans to survive and as a result of that Yukari convinced many Japanese to make themselves a new life in Gensokyo - most notably our ancestors the Clan of Hakurei.\nAfter enough humans have settled the sages created the Hakurei barrier (in reference to the first clan which settled in Gensokyo), which should seal Gensokyo away from the world forever."

The culprit was Konngara and her servants from the Old Hell.

It was the young Marisa Kirisame, an apprentice of the ghost Mima! At first these two saw each other as enemies and could not stand each other.

She introduced herself to Reimu as Yukari Yakumo and asked her what has happened to her and the shrine, which should protect the Hakurei Barrier. After hearing the sobbing Yukari has made an offer: Yukari and the other youkai sages will think a system out, which will give even the powerless youkai and humans a chance to fight back. This system will be then integrated in the shintoistic beliefs and traditions. In return, Reimu will protect this new religious direction and enforce it within Gensokyo.\n\nReimu didn't take a second to accept this offer and left the ruins of the Hakurei Shrine behind her.

After seeing Remilia's strength and fearing that Remilia would conquer Gensokyo single handily, Yukari ordered her to stick to the so called \"Spell Card System\".\n\nThe Spell Cards are an experimental dueling system, which should put beauty and grace to the focus instead of firepower. It fulfills the purpose of giving even the weakest human and youkai a legitimate fighting chance against somebody like Remilia. And while there is no pressure to stick to the system, it has become very quickly a standard to honor it nonetheless. It even goes so far so that this Spell Card System became very quickly a fundamental part of the new Hakurei Shintoism."

It didn't take long until Hakurei Shintoism has been spreading from the Hell in Higan all the way to the Perfect Cut Coast.\n\nMeanwhile, Meira has returned to the Old Hakurei Shrine to challenge Reimu again, but all she found were ruins. After hearing what has happened to Reimu and the shrine she decided to rebuild and maintain it in hope of Reimu's return. Eventually, rumors of a new \"Hakurei Shintoism\" have reached Meira and when she noticed, how caretaking the Spell Card System is, she chose to call all together, who want to stay to the true ways of Shintoism and fighting.

It's unclear what she might plan...\nYuuka tried to become the new goddess of Makai. However, she got bored of this idea and the fight with Shinki wasn't worth it for her. So she returned to Mugenkan and started creating her own sunflower field.\nShinki made sure that the demons would remain in Makai. After she said goodbye to her daughter, she let Alice leave Makai to do her own adventures.\nKonngara still slumbers in the Fallen Temple while Rika met Nitori and Yumemi and decided to create an engineers guild.\n\nOnly time will tell what the future will hold for North Gensokyo..."

His works made a great impact on the music world and even our [Root.Monarch.GetName] enjoys his compositions - especially Sonata Pathétique, which could be a magnificent theme for our $MONARCHTITLE$."

Many humans think that Hakurei Clan, Senkai, Myouren Temple and whatnot are the hubs of religious authority in Gensokyo, but this is not true. As in the end they all have to answer in front of the Yamaxanadu, who is currently a follower of the Hakurei Faith.\nFortunately, our goddess Suwako has good contact with Eiki and could convince her to switch the official religion to ours."

But for some reason both of them couldn't remember the past events as if that particular part of their memory was erased by someone. Every time Alice tried to delve deep into her mind thinking about the person in front of her, it gave the magician a painful headache. It seems reasoning under these circumstances would be quite hard."

While most of our people follow Hakurei's Shintoism ways, a few major places have been converted to Moriya's religion. Additionally the influence of Kanako over Reiuji is unsettlingly high and even Koishi seeks the Moriya Shrine more and more often. How should our realm react to these changes?"

 flavor_crd.4.desc: "Okuu and Orin, Satori's most faithful pets, have approached our mistress today asking if they'd be allowed to leave Chireiden and see the world. As bold as that request is, Mistress Satori has a tough choice to make! Releasing them might make them happy. But it would be also prudent to keep them under watch. Or disallow them entirely!"

However, like flowers, religions grow and become more and as such we follow the reformed Hakurei Shintoism. However, many people are still stuck in the past and try to undermine the state's religion by staying with the Hakurei Traditions. How should our realm react to this stubbornness?"
 flavor_sff.1.a: "Forcefully mass converting is just a game. A fun one."

 flavor_myo.24.d:0 "The monasteries of [Root.GetName] harbor some of the oldest and finest lineages in [Root.Owner.Country.GetName] and have therefore always been influential. They have, however, over the years come to grow more and more powerful and have also come to cultivate a disturbingly close relationship to other powers in the region. It is hard by now to find any person of influence in one of the monasteries that do not come from one of the richer noble families in the region. Monastic discipline is important but attacking a powerful Monastery as entrenched as this is not done lightly, a tempting option is to simply ally with the monks and let them lend their power to ours."

Centuries later she and other Menreiki, essentially Tsukumogami of masks, arrived in Gensokyo. While they follow Buddhism due to the magic, they acknowledge their origin and connection towards Miko and Taoism, which caused a religious split in Shinkirou. If the Menreiki want to be united they have to decide for one religion..."
 flavor_kko.1.a: "Taoism will lead us to our path!"

 ###EVENTS FOR MAYOHIGA###

 flavor_mhg.6.desc: "Broken and defeated, yet her pride is not lost. Remilia and I made a contract not a long time ago: I allow her to start a new life in Gensokyo and she keeps things interesting here. But apparently I became a rival of her without my knowledge why or since when. Usually I don't care if I get on the wrong side of anybody, but with a vampire child on a throne things can go south pretty fast - especially if said vampire child releases a dangerous Scarlet Mist to boost her ego.\nWell, to bad about her ego, because now her precious Mansion is under my control. I think I will let you decide how I should handle this brat."
 flavor_mhg.6.a: "Resolve this rivalry and give her a role as your bodyguard"

 flavor_mhg.6.c: "I don't care. Just take some loot from the mansion I guess."
 flavor_mhg.7.t: "The Aftermath of the Lunar War"
 flavor_mhg.7.desc: "Over a thousand years ago, the youkai of this planet went to war against the Lunarians of the Moon - and I was the one who declared war and led the armies. This war ended in a complete catastrophe and the youkai had to retreat. I justified the invasion with a hunger of the lunarian power, but I intended a different goal to achieve. You see, I already knew from the get-go that this war will end in a defeat and I wanted to demonstrate to youkai that the idea of conquest is bad.\nIt worked for a long time and Gensokyo was peaceful. Well, WAS. Now in Gensokyo everyone declares war on each other, but this wasn't my main concern.\nIn Eientei, there lives a Lunarian who can clearly remember the terror of war on the moon. In the chaos of today's Gensokyo, this Lunarian could have tried to contact their home and prepare a revenge invasion of Gensokyo. I couldn't afford such a threat, which is why a complete annihilation of Eientei was required. Also, I am not a good loser, but this a completely different topic..."
 flavor_mhg.7.a: "I didn't know such a \"powerful\" youkai could lose at anything..."

 flavor_mhg.8.t: "Restoration of the Hakurei Barrier"
 flavor_mhg.8.desc: "The Hakurei Barrier was an old shield, which prevented all foreign forces from interacting with Gensokyo. It made the continent invisible, unreachable for every non-gensokyan and it was unbreakable. But not all things can exist forever and the Barrier broke, allowing the outworld to see Gensokyo and vice versa. This change from complete isolation allowed Gensokyo to learn from the outworld ideas, but it also made a lot of youkai anxious. The peace of Gensokyo was gone and the little realms started to kill each other.\n\nBut fortunately the glorious nation of [Root.GetName] managed to restore the Hakurei Barrier and gained with it enough authority to demand every gensokyan nation to become its tributary! A new era has started in Gensokyo and it remains to be seen whether the new overlord of Gensokyo can bring back peace to Gensokyo!"
 flavor_mhg.8.a: "A new era indeed."
 flavor_mhg.8.a.tt: "Every gensokyan nation in Gensokyo receives the decision to become our tributary or to become our next target for war."
 flavor_mhg.9.t: "Symbolic Authority"
 flavor_mhg.9.desc: "It works! The news about the new Barrier is spreading throughout Gensokyo! It will take some time, but sooner or later these kids acknowledge my authority again! You see, the many realm leaders already had their conflicts with each other, but because of my role as Gensokyo's guardian they always avoided war. They feared my authority even if I was asleep. The destruction of the previous Barrier was a sign for many rulers here that I \"failed\" my job and therefore I don't have the right to manage the intern problems of Gensokyo. But now the Barrier is back..."
 flavor_mhg.9.a: "Does it mean there will be peace again?"
 flavor_mhg.9.a.tt: "Yes, but not now. And most certainly not within the next two centuries. It will take a lot of time and work, but someday peace and tranquility will return to Gensokyo. Until then we have only the support of my people and good relations with every gensokyan nation. Make the best of it, human."
 flavor_mhg.10.t: "Powerful Daimyo!"
 flavor_mhg.10.desc: "It appears one of your daimyos is grown in power. He decided that he doesn't need your \"competent\" protection any longer. I know this may annoy you, but at least it is entertaining for me."

In history, the terrifying Aztecs got annihilated by the Spaniards.\nIn this timeline, however, the Aztecs are still alive - more and less - and became our subjects. For me, humans are only humans and I don't care what shall happen to these funny bush men. But for this task, I have you, player. Should I modernize this tribe nation and convert them to the gensokyan standards? Or should they remain our little native slaves?"

 flavor_mhg.11.b: "I would like me a modernized Aztec subject..."

It almost feels like I've gone back in time again...\nBut enough of this distraction. You and I have to find a \"Blood God\". The \"\" are needed, because this \"God\" is an imposter, who collects tons of blood for some wicked magic, which protects her from my boundary manipulations. Usually I wouldn't care if a youkai kills some humans, but this one is special: 1., this youkai is gone rogue, which means she knows about Gensokyo and could cause more chaos with that knowledge than she knows, which leads us to \n2. She demands way too many sacrifices - even for aztec standards. She attracts far too much attention from the humans.\nAnd now to the last point 3) I don't like it when somebody can hide from my boundary abilities. She has to go. I know she is here somewhere, but I am not sure where exactly. She is either in Mexico, in Cholula or in Sotuta.

 flavor_mhg.22.desc: "Originally the city was nothing more than a village for fishermen. However, this has changed since the Tenno ceded the city to [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] supervision, the village evolved into an important trade city with merchants from all around the world."
 flavor_mhg.22.a: "Take this, Portugal!"
 flavor_mhg.22.a.tt: "This option is a reference to the influence of the Portugese, who originally made the village into an important trade city."
 flavor_mhg.23.t: "Emperor approves!"
 flavor_mhg.23.desc: "Apparently all the concubines of the world couldn't make the Emperor resistant against my charm. He accepted the deal with us. Macau is ours."
 flavor_mhg.23.a: "Charm? Say Yukari, you didn't eventually...?"
 flavor_mhg.23.a.tt: "Why should I? It is just a game. And for a partner like you I wouldn't dream to do such a thing, you barbarian."
 flavor_mhg.24.t: "Emperor disapproves!"
 flavor_mhg.24.desc: "He is either extremely wise to mistrust me or extremely blind to NOT see the immense money he would make if we get this city for our trade post.... he called me an old hag, too..."
 flavor_mhg.24.a: "Just take him his province away. I know you can make it happen, hag."
 flavor_mhg.24.a.tt: "First, good idea. I can just take it away.\nAnd Second, I won't hunt you down for calling me a hag. But just because I know the Emperor of China will do this for me. He will keep his core on this land, you know?"
 flavor_mhg.24.b: "Well then. We’ll just stop trading with them."
 flavor_mhg.24.b.tt: "Sounds reasonable to me. Although I still prefer to see his head rolling off his shoulders..."
 flavor_mhg.25.t: "\"A happy little Incident\""
 flavor_mhg.25.desc: "Hot, muggy, tropical - you either love or hate the indian climate. And I am not a huge fan of walking around this subcontinent with permanent sweaty dress. Uagh... But at least the mixture of so many cultures makes India interesting.\nRegardless, our goal was to find a lunarian and send her back to the moon. Well, while you captured the religious centers I've found this pesky girl. The bad news is: she sold the silk to some random guru and now it is the-gods-know-where. The good news is: she sold this silk for a jewel, which has very important meaning for many pagan humans. This means if you show them our newly found jewel they won't see you as an oppressor.\n*Annoyed gap girl sounds*\nMaybe I should send this lunarian to the sun instead..."
 flavor_mhg.25.a: "At least it's something"
 flavor_mhg.25.a.tt: "This may be true, but I don't like the idea of humans having access to a lunarian item. I think you understand what I mean... I hope the buyer is a crazy, implausible guru so nobody will buy this silk from him..."
 flavor_mhg.26.t: "Meeting in Hormuz"
 flavor_mhg.26.desc: "So let's see how much the owner wants to give his province to us. I should meet him quite soon. If Ran did a good job with her preparations, it should be an easy task..."
 flavor_mhg.26.a: "Good luck."
 flavor_mhg.27.t: "A stranger wants to buy Hormuz"
 flavor_mhg.27.desc: "An odd lady in a purple, expensive-looking dress from the far east visited our court. She claims to have a good relation with our ruler and wants to buy Hormuz from us. How shall the answer of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] look like?"
 flavor_mhg.27.a: "We should accept her offer."
 flavor_mhg.27.a.tt: "We will sell Hormuz to [From.GetName]."
 flavor_mhg.27.b: "Tell this woman that we keep this island."
 flavor_mhg.27.b.tt: "We will keep Hormuz, but we will risk insulting the stranger."
 flavor_mhg.27.c: "I know this woman. Her advisor tried to manipulate me. We cannot trust her!"
 flavor_mhg.27.c.tt: "We will send the woman back to her home and keep our independence."
 flavor_mhg.27.d: "I know this woman. Her power is unimaginable and she can protect us from all dangers!"
 flavor_mhg.27.d.tt: "We will become [From.GetName]'s vassal."
 flavor_mhg.28.t: "Purchase of Hormuz is a success!"
 flavor_mhg.28.desc: "The negotiations went as expected and I got Hormuz for our lovely, purple blob. Now we have good opportunities to conquer Babylon."
 flavor_mhg.28.a: "Do I really have to conquer it?"
 flavor_mhg.28.a.tt: "Nah. Or does our mission tree look like that of Forest of Magic?"
 flavor_mhg.29.t: "Purchase of Hormuz failed!"
 flavor_mhg.29.desc: "Ok. Apparently the owner of an underdeveloped island doesn't want a thousand Ducats. I can understand it. BUT there was no reason to insult me... Human, I think you should punish him!"
 flavor_mhg.29.a: "What's the matter? Why are you now so aggressive?"
 flavor_mhg.29.a.tt: "I hate it when somebody calls me an old hag...\nDON'T you dare to call me a hag, too, human!"
 flavor_mhg.30.t: "Hormuz becomes our puppet!"
 flavor_mhg.30.desc: "Apparently Ran's job was done better than I thought. The sultan of Hormuz doesn't offer us just Hormuz, but his entire nation if we promise him to protect him and his people from any persian, egyptian, turkish or european threat."
 flavor_mhg.30.a: "Please say you accepted his offer..."
 flavor_mhg.30.a.tt: "Of course I did! I could never say no to somebody who wants to become my subject."

 flavor_mhg.31.desc: "*You hear some angry curses far away. Suddenly a gap opens in front of you and your companion appears - visible frustrated.*\nDamn be Ran! I don't know what happened, but she managed to make the sultan careful and said lies about me like \"I'm manipulating people for fun\"... I should've sent Chen for this mission."
 flavor_mhg.31.a: "Wait, Ran screwed a mission up? How?"
 flavor_mhg.31.a.tt: "I think she made an update during her conservation with the sultan or something. I don't know, I am not familiar with shikigamis update procedure. I may be incredible intelligent, but I am not omniscient"

 flavor_mhg.34.desc: "Congratulations! You managed the capital of so many former empires - and this only for me! But there's still one minor problem: how should you manage this city if our entire power base remains in Gensokyo? The people of Constantinople will revolt without any pause...\nYou know what? I feel a little bit generous today, so I give you my idea: I could bring one of the many empires, which held or claimed Constantinople, back and let them manage the city for you. How do you find this plan, human? However, I can bring back either Byzantium or Rûm back (Don't question me. I like the pun possibilities of Rûm...). So, what is your answer, player?"
 flavor_mhg.34.a: "Let the Purple Phoenix rise again!"
 flavor_mhg.34.a.tt: "Are you by any chance a byzantiboo? Regardless, you shall have your Purple Phoenix.\nByzantine Empire will be as our puppet state released. They gain claims of the Greece part of the balkan."
 flavor_mhg.34.b: "Puns you say?... Rûm will be our Blue Phoenix!"
 flavor_mhg.34.b.tt: "Well, should your soldiers ever ask where their Rûm has gone then you know where you have to point on the map.\nRûm will be our puppet state. They gain claims all over Anatolia."
 flavor_mhg.34.c: "Ehh... didn't you have the claim, Yukari?"
 flavor_mhg.34.c.tt: "Heh? Ohh... right, I do have. But I wanted some special blobs on the map too, you know... *sighs* Ok, we can keep the city. At least promise you’ll rename the city into a funny pronunciation of \"Constantinople\"."
 flavor_mhg.35.t: "Elect a Basileus"
 flavor_mhg.35.desc: "After I brought the Byzantine Empire back, we need to give them an appropriate basileus. I could bring one of the former rulers of Byzantium to our dimension with my gaps. Just say which one I should choose."
 flavor_mhg.35.a: "How about Constantine himself?"
 flavor_mhg.35.a.tt: "Ehmm... yeah, sure. Technically he is roman and not byzantine, but I think I make an exception here."
 flavor_mhg.35.b: "The Byzantines need Justinian back!"
 flavor_mhg.35.b.tt: "The title \"the Great\" is justified for Justinian. His rule marked a great time for the Byzantine Empire. His spoken Greek was strange sometimes though."
 flavor_mhg.35.c: "Theodora would be a great leader."
 flavor_mhg.35.c.tt: "Theodora? This girl is quite temperamental, but from my personal experience, she is also a friendly person to have around."
 flavor_mhg.37.t: "Debts of an Oracle"
 flavor_mhg.37.desc: "Ahh yes... Greece. I spent more time discussing with random philosophers about the gods and the world than I would like to admit...\nAnyway, I am here for an oracle and I think I know where she hides...\n*Yukari opens a gap in space and time*\nNo... wrong oracle ... nope, that's just Medusa - you look good by the way.\n*After a minute Yukari closes the gap again*\nOk, I've found her. Apparently she was hiding in the FUTURE and spent a lot of her treasury for coffee. No wonder I couldn't find her earlier. Regardless, after I reminded her and teleported her to the mad lunarians a few times she was finally ready to pay us. Here player, have the cash. I don't need it."
 flavor_mhg.37.a: "Then why did you make this hassle in the first place?"
 flavor_mhg.37.a.tt: "This \"hassle\" wasn't about collecting some worthless money. It was about to give somebody a lecture to hold to their promises. If I can give you advice: if you have bills to pay then do it immediately or else it will come back and bite you in your most valuable place."
 flavor_mhg.38.t: "Purchase of Gibraltar"
 flavor_mhg.38.desc: "It is time to make the Iberians an offer. Because it is kind of your treasury, you should decide how much money you want to throw at them."

 flavor_mhg.38.c.tt: "A perfectly balanced offer as all things should be.\n0 or more relations with the owner are required to get the province."
 flavor_mhg.38.d: "A small offer of a 1500 Ducats should convince the Iberians."
 flavor_mhg.38.d.tt: "Ha, are you not convinced of your good relations with the Iberians? Well, I think 1500 Ducats could be enough.\n-100 or more relations with the owner are required to get the province."

 flavor_mhg.38.e.tt: "Hey! What do you have against my references?! You know, it is quite boring to just have some standard text..."
 flavor_mhg.38.f: "We don't really use a base in Europe - at least not there..."

 flavor_mhg.39.t: "Offer of a strange foreign"
 flavor_mhg.39.desc: "Our ruler got a message from a weird woman who wants to buy Gibraltar from us. She is definitely up to something, but her offer speaks volumes of their interests..."

 flavor_mhg.39.b: "She brought a little gift for us. I think it won't do any harm to let her have the boulder."
 flavor_mhg.39.c: "The offer is at least fair..."

 flavor_mhg.39.e: "Screw the rules for national safety! She has money!"
 flavor_mhg.39.f: "This woman is a dangerous hag and can't be trusted! Send her offer back to her puppet!"
 flavor_mhg.40.t: "Purchase was a success!"
 flavor_mhg.40.desc: "Looks like your offer could convince the Iberians. It seems you are diplomatically more competent than I thought - or you just wasted way too much money. I don't know nor do I really care... Nonetheless, you did good."
 flavor_mhg.40.a: "Was this... a compliment? From you?"
 flavor_mhg.40.a.tt: "Bullying you the entire time gets boring too, you know..."

I was just humming Preußens Gloria. You can say whatever you want about Prussians, but you have to admit that their military march is really catchy... Ok, back to business: I see you conquered the lovely city of Königsberg so we have now a good supply of well trained mercs. I have thought about it and I think it would be more fun if we had Prussia as a puppet state. I mean, mercenaries can be really strong, but nothing can really beat Prussian discipline - well, apart from Remilia's military state experiment.\nIf you think Prussia is a little bit too ordinary I could also bring the Teutons back. What would you love to see?"
 flavor_mhg.42.a: "A prussian subject sounds fun indeed. I didn't know you are a wehraboo by the way..."
 flavor_mhg.42.a.tt: "A wehraboo? Just because I think their march song is catchy? Not really. Especially if you consider what these Germans will do in the time period after EU4..."
 flavor_mhg.42.b: "The Teutons you say? I think some old school knights would be nice to have around."

While you were busy fighting the vikings off I managed to find my friend, the enchanter - a magician youkai, who managed to live with the Swedes together. She improves their arsenal and the humans leave her alone. It is good to see her doing well.\nAnd Apparently the enchanter of the ice was happy to see me too! She gave me some documents about the Kalmar Union I lost, some enchanted weapons for our army and navy!"
 flavor_mhg.43.a: "Say, why isn't this powerful youkai in Gensokyo yet?"
 flavor_mhg.43.a.tt: "Because she doesn't want to live there. You see, Gensokyo is a safe haven for all kinds of youkai, but nobody is forced to live there - especially if you don't draw much attention to you in the outworld. My enchanter friend lived in Scandinavia for so long she became part of the local myths - and she is happy about it."

Fortunately she and I made a pact long ago: if Yuyuko begins to become a threat to Gensokyo I am allowed to claim her throne until she calms down. Of course the pact goes the other way too.\nPlease, let me talk to her. I want to see if she is still corrupted by the tree or not. Alternatively we could enforce our claim on Yuyuko's throne directly if you think she doesn't have full control of her mind.\nI will wait for your answer."

Due to Mokou having lived a long time in the forest and knowing every little corner to hide, capturing her and banishing her is nearly impossible.\n\nTo keep this land somewhat stable, Eirin thought out a system of power balance: Mokou and Kaguya are not only literal enemies but also represent different mindsets of how to rule this forest. Whoever dominates the other rival gets to enforce their politics within our land. However, if the power struggle isn't in balance the dominated rival will start to become rebellious.\nThis will be challenging times for our nation until a truce between those hot heads is established."

 flavor_fuj.1.t: "Immortal Rivalry"
 flavor_fuj.1.desc: "With our conquest of Eientei we finally ended the national rivalry and now dominate the entire Bamboo Forest. But peace is a rare sight in this forest: Eientei may not exist anymore, but the head of this clan, Kaguya Houraisan, still lives on - and is now part of our realm and causes now internal struggles! Due to Kaguya having lived a  long time in the forest and having connections with the rabbits, who know every little corner to hide, capturing her and banishing her is nearly impossible.\n\nTo keep this land somewhat stable, Eirin thought out of a system of power balance: Kaguya and Mokou are not only literal enemies but also represent different mindsets of how to rule this forest. Whoever dominates the other rival gets to enforce their politics within our land. However, if the power struggle isn't in balance the dominated rival will start to become rebellious.\nThese will be challenging times for our nation until a truce between those hot heads is established."
 flavor_fuj.1.a: "At least it won't get boring any time soon."
 flavor_fuj.2.t: "The Phoenix and the Were-hakutaku"
 flavor_fuj.2.desc: "It is unknown since when they have been friends, but it is public knowledge that they are very good and close friends. Mokou and Keine Kamishirasawa know each other very well and took care of each other until Terakoya had to stop any contact with people outside the Human Capital due to the general unrest in Gensokyo. Now, after Terakoya became part of [Root.GetName], the relationship of them can flourish yet again. It even goes so far that Keine is offering her skills for our court!"
 flavor_fuj.2.a: "We will be more than glad to have Keine in our court!"
 fuj_can_hire_keine_now_tt: "We can now hire Keine via a decision!"
 flavor_fuj.3.t: "Fujiwaran Legacy"
 flavor_fuj.3.desc: "One of our court's historians found some old writings from the old Nara era of Japan. Those writings documented all the achievements the Fujiwara clan made in politics and in the Imperial Family. Even better, they even give us legit claims over Japanese land and even the throne of the Tenno!"
 flavor_fuj.3.a: "The Fujiwara clan will return to Japan!"
 flavor_fuj.4.t: "End of the Rivalry?"
 flavor_fuj.4.desc: "Many years have gone past since Eientei became part of [Root.GetName], but the rivalry was always on going between those two hotheads - until this day! As Mokou brought the results of the five impossible requests to Lady Kaguya, she fulfilled her part of the deal. Although Kaguya didn't expect this to happen she must admit that her requests are finally done after so many years and now declared to be ready to end this rivalry finally once and for all! To celebrate this both girls have agreed to act more in our nation's interest instead of their own!"
 flavor_fuj.4.tt: "The likelihood of negative events caused by unbalanced strife is greatly reduced now!"
 flavor_fuj.4.a: "Great! We could use Mokou's fire power now."
 flavor_fuj.4.b: "Great! We could use Kaguya's diplomacy now."
 flavor_fuj.5.t: "Humans join our Realm!"
 flavor_fuj.5.desc: "Gensokyo is a dangerous place - especially for the simple humans without any powers. Those poor souls have it especially harder since every other nation around them prepares for war is already fighting wars out. Fortunately, they are aware of their situation and of our status as a guardian of the humans. It was no surprise when the mayor of the Human Capital reached out to us and asked us if his land can join ours in order to give the humans the proper protection from all the bloodthirsty youkai around them."
 flavor_fuj.5.a: "We will gladly protect them from Gensokyo's dangers!"
 flavor_fuj.6.t: "Tenno of Japan"
 flavor_fuj.6.desc: "The old Tenno was a weak figurehead for our ancestors. He allowed his general to let a civil war break out and just sit on his throne while his subjects slaughtered each other. This ends now! With our conquest of Japan and the old rights of the Fujiwara Clan, Fujiwara no Mokou is now the last legitimated successor for the Tenno's throne - and under her rule Japan will never fear a Sengoku era again!"
 flavor_fuj.6.a: "A new era starts for Japan!"
 flavor_fuj.6.tt: "Release all Japanese daimyos and make them to our subjects. While they  are our daimyos they cannot declare war against each other."
 flavor_fuj.8.t: "The Five Impossible Requests"
 flavor_fuj.8.desc: "Eientei may be a thing of the past, but Kaguya is still a nuisance for our mistress and causes chaos within our borders. It went so far that one day Keine Kamishirasawa came personally to our court and organized a meeting with Mokou and Kaguya. Her plan is to finish this rivalry - and she managed it... more or less. Thanks to Keine's service, Kaguya was ready to make a deal with Mokou: she will stop with the rivalry when Mokou manages to fulfill the Five Impossible Requests her father never did."
 flavor_fuj.8.a: "This princess is really getting on my nerves..."
 flavor_fuj.8.tt: "Get claims over all provinces, which are required for the Five Impossible Requests.\nIncrease Mokou's stress by 250%."
 flavor_fuj.9.t: "Shooting cannons at swallows!"
 flavor_fuj.9.desc: "The sky is filled with pesky swallows which scream and fly. One of the soldiers even complained he got hit by the bird's natural ... attacks. Mokou and Kaguya are there too. While Mokou prepares the cannon, Kaguya observes her rival from a distance and throws pejorative insults around her. Usually the Swallow's Cowrie Shell is really easy to get, but Kaguya insisted on having a blast of a show...\nMokou said the cannon was ready. It only takes one order to shoot the swallows out of the sky ... or to bring some real entertainment for Mokou..."
 flavor_fuj.9.a: "Shoot at the birds!"
 flavor_fuj.9.b: "Shoot at Kaguya!"
 flavor_fuj.10.t: "Shooting at birds is fun..."
 flavor_fuj.10.desc: "BOOM!\nThe loud cannon fire noises can only be surpassed by the death rattles of the birds. And the applause of Kaguya. Apparently she found a liking in Mokou following her orders. It didn't take long until Mokou had the Cowrie Shell for Kaguya."
 flavor_fuj.10.a: "I hope she is happy with her entertainment..."
 flavor_fuj.11.t: "...but shooting at princesses is more fun!"
 flavor_fuj.11.desc: "\"Fire!\" Mokou yelled. And her men shot the cannons - but not at the pesky birds but on something way more annoying. The cannonballs flew directly at Kaguya, shredded clothes completely apart and threw her off the dock. In her flight, Kaguya took an unfortunate bird with her, which had the Cowrie Shell!"
 flavor_fuj.11.a: "Absolutely worth it!"
 flavor_fuj.12.t: "Dragon Fight!"
 flavor_fuj.12.desc: "In the far north, there is a secret dragon shrine from ancient times. Finding it was the easy part. Now comes the more troublesome of actually getting the jewel from the Dragon's neck. Fortunately, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a competent fighter!"
 flavor_fuj.12.a: "Phoenix versus Dragon! Who will win?"

 flavor_fuj.14.a.tt: "The Dragon Jewel Request is fulfilled now!"
 flavor_fuj.15.t: "Defeat"
 flavor_fuj.15.desc: "Dragons are no easy foes. This is something our ruler had to learn the hard way. When the guards entered the dragon cave, the only thing they found was a huge empty place and a smoking body on the ground. Next to it was a jewel, which looked like the one Kaguya asked for..."
 flavor_fuj.15.a: "At least I have the jewel..."
 flavor_fuj.15.a.tt: "The Dragon Jewel Request is fulfilled now!"
 flavor_fuj.101.t: "Mokou returns!"

Several primary candidates have been nominated..."
 ###EVENTS FOR FOREST OF MAGIC FLAVOR###
 flavor_fom.1.t: "The New Hourai Elixir!"
 flavor_fom.1.desc: "We finally managed to create a new Hourai Elixir! We have traveled around the world, fought bitter battles and encountered strange cultures. Now all these troubles have borne fruit, although there is only a limited amount of Hourai Potions and its effect isn't quite as potent as the Lunar version. Regardless it is good enough to give the user a long life, but who should take a shot?"
 flavor_fom.1.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] shall drink the potion."
 flavor_fom.1.b: "It was Marisa's idea and she should get the potion."

 flavor_fom.4.d: "Nah."
 flavor_fom.5.t: "Patchouli's Interest"
 flavor_fom.5.desc: "Our marketing strategy did not take long to get us the attention of several mages of Gensokyo. The most surprising one however is Patchouli herself, who has decided to leave the library for once and to check out what is going on here. When she realized, that Marisa and Alice were fond of Patchouli's rather random idea of a school for magic, she decided to join us as an advisor for our mistresses and as the librarian for the academy!"
 flavor_fom.5.a: "Glad to see her on board now!"
 fom_can_hire_patchouli_now_tt: "We can now hire Patchouli via a decision!"
 flavor_fom.6.t: "Ellen's Second Business"
 flavor_fom.6.desc: "Long, blonde hair. Red and white witch outfit and a bow instead of the classic hat. Marisa has heard it often that the visual similarities between her and Ellen are quite obvious. However, the personalities are clearly different.\nEllen is quite childish and spontaneous.\nStill, when it comes to business she beats Marisa as she has announced that her new home, the place which we used to call part of the Youkai Trail, will also become her second shop in Gensokyo.... or rather her cat's shop as she will be busy with teaching young witches and magicians about the Art of the Merchant."
 flavor_fom.6.a: "She is quite the ... special ... witch."
 flavor_fom.7.t: "The Jizou Statues"
 flavor_fom.7.desc: "Narumi is not a natural born magician nor was she ever a human. She was once a lifeless Jizou statue, which purpose was to guide the deceased young. However when she became sentient her role has shifted: she is no longer guiding the dead but creating the statues, who does the job for her now. With her ability of affecting life she is a valuable teacher for the school of Alteration Magic and a spiritual guide for our realm."
 flavor_fom.7.a: "I wonder if she teaches biology too."
 flavor_fom.8.t: "Scrolls of the Myouren Temple"
 flavor_fom.8.desc: "We have gained three magical scrolls from the Myouren Temple. However, they are sealed with a special spell, which can be only broken with a special designed key. Luckily, Narumi has one as she is quite close to the Buddhist practices. It is now up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] which scroll should be studied."

 flavor_fom.9.t: "A Song of Ice and Fire"
 flavor_fom.9.desc: "It took for the two friends some time to get used to the Forest environment, but they have shown clear joy in their work as teachers of the destructive nature of magic. Even better: they also have sworn Alice to protect her and their new home by freezing all invaders slowly or by burning their war efforts to ash."
 flavor_fom.9.a: "I am glad to hear it."
 flavor_fom.10.t: "Gensokyo's Academy of Magic"
 flavor_fom.10.desc: "It took a lot of convincing, fighting and bribing; borrowing and spell casting. But in the end the great ambition of Marisa, Alice and Patchouli has been finished! From this day forward every magician, witch, mage, warlock, sorcerer, wizard and summoner can enjoy to have a place they all can call home and can teach their magic to all, who want to step in their paths!"

They might serve Shinki, but due to Alice's birth right as the Daughter of Makai they have an oath to serve Alice as much as they do it for the goddess.\nHowever, when our mistress Alice confronted them they demanded that she has to prove herself first - and this through the traditional Danmaku Duel!"

They might serve Shinki, but due to Alice's birth right as the Daughter of Makai they have an oath to serve Alice as much as they do it for the goddess.\nHowever, [Root.Monarch.GetName] confronted the two witches and reminded them of their oath, of which they replied that they will only hear [Root.Monarch.GetName] when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] defeats them in a traditional Danmaku Duel!"

 flavor_fom.15.t: "Defeat against Mai and Yuki"
 flavor_fom.15.desc: "Mai and Yuki are experienced witches of destruction and as they channeled the powers of Frost and Fire, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] just couldn't handle them. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was forced to retreat in the end."

 flavor_fom.15.a.tt: "You can encounter the witches §Y5 Years§! later again."
 flavor_fom.16.t: "From Meat to Sugar"
 flavor_fom.16.desc: "It took a while, but after Rumia has tasted the sweetness of sugar and honey in the Back Door's Realm she fully \"converted\" to a much sweeter diet - and due to her youkai physiology the sugar does not have a negative effect on her body either.\nWhen the humans of Gensokyo heard of this news they celebrated [Root.Monarch.GetName] for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] banishment of the Rumia threat."
 flavor_fom.16.a: "Well, what can i say, except you're welcome."

While she is not as popular as the other great deities of Gensokyo, she at least gets the attention of her fellow residents of the Youkai forest. However, this changed with the arrival of the Moriya Clan in the west and now some of our people started to worship the gods from the Moriya Clan instead..."
 flavor_yof.1.a: "We already hardly have any worshippers! We need to convince them!"

Our realm managed to throw the Scarlet shackles away and it is now time to forge our own destiny - and [Root.Monarch.GetName] already has an idea what it will be about: the liberation of other fairies, which are slaves! While this goal is very honorable, many fairies don't know how we should treat the oppressors when we turn the tables and integrate them into our realm. Half of the fairies cry for vengeance for the crimes against the fairy-kind while the other half demands of us to be better than the oppressors.\nIn the end, only the strongest fairy - [Root.Monarch.GetName] - can decide for [Root.GetName]..."

As we conquered this strange land we found a lot of fairies and freed them from there, but we also found native fairies there! These Makaian fairies could make excellent new friends for Cirnia. On the other hand [Root.Monarch.GetName] can travel to the World of Snow and Ice and try to absorb some of its power. The decision is hers..."

Still, just like Reimu, Sanae too did many crimes against the fairies and shall pay for it. However, because the Moriya lands are far away from the Fairy Lands and because Sanae's crimes are less severe she got her punishment without a trial!"

During the long danmaku fight both fairies went out of magic to use any danmaku so they even started going into melee and fought the last five minutes with bare fists!

 flavor_lil.2.desc: "Satori doesn't get visitors that regularly and when some then they are usually some incident investigators. Because of that, Satori was quite surprised when a simple-minded fairy - Lily White to be more precise - entered her mansion. The spring fairy stuttered and her fear was quite visible; she was unable to say a decent word. Luckily for her, our good mistress is a mindreader. After searching in Lily's minds, Satori learns that this weak fairy seeks Chireiden's support against Remilia Scarlet.\nWhile Lily is very unimpressive, her little home does actually have strategical potential. In case of a war with Scarlet Realm, Lily will us serve as a meat shield against Remilia's forces and maybe she will even become our vassal when feels safe enough again..."
 flavor_lil.2.a: "Hmmm... Orin mentioned that she could use more zombie fairies."
 flavor_lil.2.a.tt: "We will support Lily in her strive to fight against Remilia. In return we will be able to demand her absolute obedience when Remilia has been neutralized."

 flavor_lil.4.t: "Satori declines the Alliance"
 flavor_lil.4.desc: "Despite Lily's best attempts, Satori was not convinced by our beloved ruler. She called Lily as \"replaceable\" and \"useless\" and sent her packing! Even though we lack the power now, we will not forget this insult and will repay it to her!"

 flavor_lil.5.t: "Komeiji's Demand"
 flavor_lil.5.desc: "It has been done! The Scarlet Devil has been defeated and her mansion has been liberated from the vampires! The many fairy maidens joined now our cause while of the residents every sign has been missing.\nWhile these are great news for Lily, they also mean something more worrisome: our good fairy lady made a pact with Satori Komeiji for the safety of [Root.GetNmae]. In return, the fairies of [Root.GetName] serve Satori in her campaign shall the Scarlet Devil be eliminated - and now Satori reminds Lily of this pact quite drastically.\nLily now has to decide if she wants our realm to submit to the satori or if she wants us to deny this pact and risk a war against Chireiden..."

Although the tree will always remain a threat in Gensokyo and the evil within is not destroyable, we at least managed to seal it away. However, the remaining spring energy of the tree has been freed! Now it is up to Lily to harness it and bring harmony and prosperity to our realm!"
 flavor_lil.12.a: "It will be a pleasure!"
 flavor_lil.13.t: "Eternal Spring"
 flavor_lil.13.desc: "It is done! Lily managed to harness the Spring Power from the evil demon tree and used it to bring prosperity to our people in Gensokyo!

This changed though when Star came to her with a rather upset face and told her about what she has experienced in the Human Capital.

It was nobody else than [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], the servant of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s good friend Hecatia and now our subject. The reason for her visit was a proposal: [From.Monarch.GetName] wants to continue helping us against the lunarians. However, [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] wishes to help us in [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] own, independent ways. While it means a lost of a subject it would mean for us a powerful ally..."
 flavor_clp.2.a: "So be it."
 flavor_clp.2.b: "That sounds like a horrible idea. Sorry [From.Monarch.GetName]."
 flavor_clp.3.t: "Independence of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_clp.3.desc: "Benevolent Junko listened to the request of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Now, [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName] will be on an equal footing, working together on a common goal: the elimination of the lunarians!"

 flavor_clp.4.t: "Goddess of the Hell"
 flavor_clp.4.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] visited her master, Hecatia, and reported on what has happened so far. After that, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] asked if Hecatia could loosen her grip over [Root.GetName]. Although the relationship between Hecatia and Clownpiece was of a goddess and her subject, it seemed more like a mother-daughter relationship. Because of that, Hecatia had no troubles with giving her favourite fairy more freedom.\nHowever, the question of religion was still open. [Root.Monarch.GetName] doesn't care too much about religions and our [Root.GovernmentName] follows the Lunarian faith because of convenience with the locals. Hecatia made the offer to entrust her realm in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s hands if we all convert to Hakurei Shintoism with her as the only deity. Her other idea was to form a strong alliance with us if we just only abandon the Lunarian faith.\nOf course Hecatia would not mind if we continue like we do it before though..."
 flavor_clp.4.a: "I take your offer, mistress Hecatia!"
 flavor_clp.4.a.tt: "As long the moon campaign is going we are only allowed to have §YHecatia§! as our active deity. If we break this promise Hecatia will punish us severely."
 flavor_clp.4.b: "We will make a powerful alliance together!"
 flavor_clp.4.c: "Thank you Hecatia, but I think we should keep the Lunarian faith."
 flavor_clp.4.c.tt: "Hecatia will accept [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decision and nothing will happen."
 flavor_clp.5.t: "Anger of Hecatia"
 flavor_clp.5.desc: "Hecatia is not a God who needs humans faith like the other gods of Gensokyo, so even if someone doesn't believe in her, she doesn't mind it usually. However, she still values honesty and keeping promises high - something [Root.GetName] has failed at! We decided to leave the care of Hecatia and now we have angered the once generous goddess! And the anger of the Goddess of Hell, will be more fierce than any other god of Gensokyo..."
 flavor_clp.5.a: "Please forgive me! It was a mistake!"

 flavor_clp.6.desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] swore to have Hecatia as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal deity again. As result of this, Hecatia stopped her wrath and forgave [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Although, she still warned [Root.Monarch.GetName] to not make her angry again..."
 flavor_clp.6.a: "I promise this won't happen again."
 flavor_clp.7.t: "Utter Defeat of the Lunarians"
 flavor_clp.7.desc: "It is done! The arrogant lunarians, who threatened the very peace of all what is important to us, are gone; defated and broken! The moon has been liberated from the lunarians and now it is in the possession of Junko, Hecatia and us! In recognition of our massive contribution to this victory, Hecatia and Junko gave us their blessing and even entrust us with the administration of the Moon! Additionally, Hecatia has lifted all religious bounds which were on [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 flavor_clp.7.a: "The Moon is our world now! Finally!"
 flavor_clp.7.a.tt: "We will no longer suffer Hecatia's wrath if we should have a deity other than Hecatia."

 flavor_clp.8.desc: "The moon fairies have just set foot on the Earth's New World, but they can see there is a vast stretch of land that is constantly unfolded with their little eyes - and it is a beautiful land full of life beyond comparison with the Moon or Hell! Some fairies are even requesting [Root.Monarch.GetName] to migrate here; to move away from the barren Moon and complex Gensokyo. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is still briefed with our realm's activities on the Moon, but it seems necessary to seriously consider the moon fairy explorers' suggestions..."

Now that he has succeeded in revenge, Junko is trying to call us back to serve her yet again. However, our good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] doubts that Junko really needs us back. After all, we played the biggest role in the defeat of the lunarians.

The only thing Junko really cared for was her vengeance against the lunarians and now that Clownpiece showed her competence as a leader, Junko has taken her hands off complicated governance, entrusted her throne and people to Clownpiece and decided to rest quietly. Well, for her quietly... Chang'e won't have the same luxury though..."

 ###EVENT FOR ETERNITY GARDEN###
 flavor_lar.1.t: "The Potential of Eternity Larva"
 flavor_lar.1.desc: "After our march into the Youkai Forest and the militaristic victory against Hina and the Aki sisters, Eternity Larva took a rest in the Shrine of Harvest. While glaring at the Misty Lake, the three defeated goddesses approached the young fairy. Even though they were former enemies, the Aki sisters nor Hina are goddesses who clings to grudge. Instead they talked with our good mistress and felt something suspicious with her: they claim that Eternity Larva might be indeed more than just a fairy, if not even a goddess, confirming the claim Okina made a long time ago! Eternity can't really believe what they say and continued glancing at the Misty Lake long after they have left her again..."
 flavor_lar.1.a: "How should I know if they are right?"
 flavor_lar.2.t: "The Orange Flower"
 flavor_lar.2.desc: "When Eternity Larva took the flower for herself she had a strange feeling. The flower disintegrated in her hand, but it in a beautiful glimmer. Apparently, it was indeed the very flower Eternity received centuries ago from the humans, worshiping her when she was a goddess and now this flower transferred its power to Eternity!"
 flavor_lar.2.a: "I'm still worthy!"
 flavor_lar.3.t: "The Butterflies of Gensokyo"
 flavor_lar.3.desc: "The cherry blossoms of Netherworld are swirling in the wind when Eternity arrived at the foot of the demon tree Saigyou Ayakashi. Without her noticing, Yuyuko Saigyouji, the mistress of Netherworld, appeared behind Eternity Larva and asked her if Eternity likes the cherry blossoms of this realm. She then noted that she too lost her memory of who she was before she became the ghost lady she is today. When Yuyuko tried to gather the spirit energy for finding out more about her past she of course didn't calculate the threat she posed for Gensokyo and she still feels sorry for it.\nHours have passed and both Yuyuko and Eternity found more parallels like their connection to butterflies. In the end, Yuyuko's daily duties have called for her, but before she vanished she casted a spell on the tree, which transfers some of the remaining spring energy to Eternity Larva, granting her access to the memories she once had as the god Tokoyo no Kami."
 flavor_lar.3.a: "Thank you, Lady Yuyuko!"
 flavor_lar.4.t: "The Claims against Kaguya"
 flavor_lar.4.desc: "Eternity Larva is known for her kindness and friendliness, but when it comes to her entrance she is as elegant and friendly as a fairy can be: marching into the house of a stranger like an elephant visiting the Chinaware store and throwing bunch of claims against Kaguya's head. The princess, completely shocked and puzzled of what was just happening required ten seconds before she was able to react to the claims of Eternity with a loud \"What?!\"...\nAfter a rather painful danmaku fight for Eternity, the situation has relaxed and Kaguya explains to our good mistress, that she has no idea of what the reason could be for Eternity's loss of power. Eternity felt more than bad for what she has done, but Kaguya was in a good mood, so she let Eirin made a potion, which should strengthen Eternity's current powers - even though it doesn't restore her godhood."
 flavor_lar.4.a: "I am so sorry again, Lady Kaguya!"
 flavor_lar.5.t: "Rebirth of Tokoyo no Kami!"
 flavor_lar.5.desc: "Eternity Larva went for the day into her chambers and slept in a cocoon made out of the finest silk our people could find for her. According to her this process is completely unnecessary, but she felt like it fits the most as her appearance in Gensokyo so far was the one of a fairy with butterfly wings. At the next day, Eternity has awakened and broke out of her cocoon. Instead of a fairy who looked like a girl around the age of eight, there was now a fully grown woman with butterfly wings larger than even the already impressive bat wings of the Scarlet Devil.\nAlthough her name is now Tokoyo no Kami, the new goddess still prefers to be called by her fairy name Eternity Larva."
 flavor_lar.5.a: "I never thought I would grow up this way."
 flavor_lar.6.t: "Eternal Warriors"
 flavor_lar.6.desc: "Although Tokoyo no Kami is no goddess of war, she is aware that in times of conflicts people have to arm themselves and have to fight. Because of that, she blessed some of fighters and declared them \"Eternal Warriors\". These soldiers are quite tough in melee combat.\nHowever, even they are not immortal and should they fall these warriors need new recruits - and not everyone is okay with being conscripted and blessed to fight."
 flavor_lar.6.a: "In times of war everyone needs to do their service."
 flavor_lar.6.b: "We should limit the recruitment to a minimum."
 flavor_lar.7.t: "Focus of [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_lar.7.desc: "Tokoyo no Kami was once a small fairy before she reawakened her abilities as goddess. Before she was able to go through this metamorphosis she had to focus her energies on one aspect of life after another. Our [Root.GovernmentName] should take an example of her and should also focus on our internal and external policies."
 flavor_lar.7.a: "We should take a focus on the internal policies."
 flavor_lar.7.b: "The external policies shall be our focus."
 flavor_lar.7.c: "Both aspects are equally important. We should be more balanced with our focus."
 flavor_lar.8.t: "Real Estate for real Worship"
 flavor_lar.8.desc: "Every goddess needs subjects to worship them so they can gain power which they need to protect their subjects in return and Tokoyo no Kami is no exception. However, worshipping a deity needs space as temples must be constructed and people need to be hired to keep said temples intact. Fortunately, our realm has estates, which can take care of this tiresome task."
 flavor_lar.8.a: "Is is only natural that the Shrine Maidens should take care of it."
 flavor_lar.8.b: "The Burghers should see more of Tokoyo no Kami's grace."
 flavor_lar.8.c: "Our Youkai could take care of the shrines."
 flavor_lar.8.d: "It is better if the Crown handles the temples itself."
 flavor_lar.9.t: "Tribute to Tokoyo no Kami"
 flavor_lar.9.desc: "Our beloved goddess Tokoyo no Kami is a relatively young one compared to the others in Gensokyo. As such she still has to grow in power. Fortunately, our realm can contribute to her growth by paying her tribute in form of special trade goods we have not monopolized yet. In exchange, Tokoyo no Kami will grant us her blessing! It is up to us though what trade good we will pay to her."

 flavor_lar.10.t: "The Mental Fight with Okina Matara"
 flavor_lar.10.desc: "The utter destruction of the Land of the Back Doors was the first step to claim Okina's power. The next one requires the defeat of the Goddess through the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. However, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is only a fairy and as such would be obliterated in a fair danmaku fight against Okina. It would require a lot of absurd power to face her and only the lack of self preservation would allow to have full access to this power - something, which only Cirno manages to do.\nFortunately, there is a different way to defeat a goddess, which is by defeating her in a Test of Endurance. Basically, [Root.Monarch.GetName] bets that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will endure all of Okina's tricks, manipulations and what not and will succumb to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arch rival. Should [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] win Okina will be humiliated and will be forced to transfer parts of her powr to [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 flavor_lar.13.t: "Victory over Okina!"
 flavor_lar.13.desc: "Despite Okina's best efforts, in the end she didn't manage to break our good ruler's iron will! In a Test of Endurance, it was [Root.Monarch.GetName] who overcame all of Okina's challenges and didn't fall for her tricks.

 flavor_lar.14.desc: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetName] has given [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] best, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] succumbed to Okina's schemes and power in the end anyway. Of course Okina takes this to her fullest advantage and builds her own power within our realm! It will take time to purge the influence of this evil deity in our land, but until then our country has to endure her."

 ###EVENTS FOR SUNFLOWER FIELD###
 flavor_sff.1.t: "Question of Religious Direction"
 flavor_sff.1.desc: "The Sunflower Fields is one of the older countries in Gensokyo. Our nation saw the first rise of the Hakurei Religion and the incidents of the past. However, like flowers, religions grow and become more and as such we follow the reformed Hakurei Shintoism. However, many people are still stuck in the past and try to undermine the state's religion by staying with the Hakurei Traditions. How should our realm react to this stubbornness?"

Her suggestion was that the two rulers, as before, would fight a danmaku fight like in old times and if she won, we should quit the war efforts immediately. It's anachronistic, but on the contrary, if it ends in [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s victory, we may be able to confirm our victory and make her a bigger demand than we had ever planned..."

Since we've come all the way here, would you like a gift? Oh, but I can't just give it to you. Where would be the challenge in that? No, you should fight for your gift.

The Onin War as well as the many years have shown their signs on him and he was believed to be dead, but this old man still was very much alive when Yuuka found him. Yoshimasa explained Yuuka the many secrets of not only Ikebana but also his others passions like tea ceremonies and architecture.\nIn the end of Yuuka's visit, the old artist wished to follow Yuuka to Gensokyo because the many conflicts in connection to his family and the shogunate are too much for him.

To use the transfer ability, we have to first give the territories 'Yuuka's Mark', which will reduce the development cost of every territorial provinces with more than 3 development, but will not increase their development. Then we need to develop the this territorial province. By doing so, all territorial provinces will lose 'Yuuka's Mark' and the whole area, which is owned by [Root.GetName], will gain the province modifier 'The Blossoming'.\nAfter that, we can use the decision \"Transfer Nature's Power\", which will reduce all the development of the provinces with the modifier to §R3§! development in total. However, the development of these provinces will be transfered to a random owned province in \"the Sunflower Fields\".

 th_japan_events.1.desc: "For a long time Gensokyo was called a myth - a legend. But in the year 1443 a group of sailors reported a strange flare in the east and have found youkai - mystical creatures from our old mythology. Because of the recent events in Japan there was never an attempt to conquer this land and unite its humans with us, their ancestors, until now!"
 th_japan_events.1.a: "The time has come to tame this wild land."
 th_japan_events.2.t: "Gensokyan Humans"
 th_japan_events.2.desc: "Gensokyo is filled with unnatural people and foes like tengu, kappa, oni and other youkai, but it also houses actual humans! These people emigrated a very long time ago and were thought to be lost and dead in the ocean. Apparently they did not and created their own society in Gensokyo. Their language and tradition is rather outdated but still Japanese. With a little effort the humans can adapt to our modern standards."
 th_japan_events.2.a: "They are still Japanese. We just have to remind them."
 th_japan_events.2.b: "No, there is no need to modernize them. But their culture will enrich ours for sure."
 th_japan_events.2.a.tt: "Every owned Human province will switch their culture to our primary culture, but the Gensokyan humans won't be happy. The cultural adaptation costs in future events less."

 th_japan_events.3.desc: "When the first Japanese arrived in the land of legends and myths, they brought not only our language but also our religion. After hundreds of years their religion developed to something completely new, yet it still resembles the old ways of Shintoism of Japan. It is unclear, if they are our religious brethren and sisters, heretics or even heathens..."
 th_japan_events.3.a: "They are our brethren and sisters! Their view of Shintoism is now ours!"
 th_japan_events.3.b: "We should allow them to live their Shinto way in harmony with ours."
 th_japan_events.3.c: "There is nothing which resembles their superstition with our religion! They are just heathens!"
 th_japan_events.6.t: "Fujiwara no Mokou"
 th_japan_events.6.desc: "The Fujiwara Clan is an old family in Japan and had a very powerful influence over the Emperor. During the Heian Period they dominated Japanese politics with the marriages of their daughters to the Emperor. One of these daughters was Mokou, who gained immortality by drinking the gift of the Emperor - the Hourai Elixir. After these events, Mokou vanished while her clan declined and split in Japan. \nBut now we found Mokou in this wild land of Gensokyo and she seeks an audience with the Emperor."

 th_japan_events.7.desc: "Usually the Emperor isn't involved with the diplomatic and militaristic challenges of our country, but he received a visit from an unusual girl - Fujiwara no Mokou, the last legitimate member of the Fujiwara Clan. \nThe Emperor decided to close the case of the Hourai Elixir and rehabilitated her and the Fujiwara Clan and allowed her to live completely free in Japan. Also the Emperor sent us a generous gift for our expansion into Gensokyo and for helping find this girl."

 touhou_setting.1.desc: "Gensokyo is land full of mysteries and magical events. It isn't unusual for us to experience drastic events, which are named as 'Incidents'. These Incidents alter the way the power balance is in Gensokyo and how the player has to watch out for his AI neighbours, because the incidents have very powerful (positive as well as negative) effects for a lot of nations. Now to the question: do you wish to deal with these events, or should I, the merciful Yukari, deactivate them for you?"

But as you have seen, fate and chronological orders don't have to align with reality and neither you nor any other human is controlling Reimu's little realm too...

For everyone curious what happened: here at the Bunbunmaru News we had some technical problems and a very, very angry White Wolf Tengu. I won't name any names, but said wolf caused major havoc and wrecked our printing press. But now they are repaired and we can finally begin to write Gensokyo's news stories, gossip and scandals! Have fun while reading!\n - Shameimaru Aya\n\n\n*It is possible that the articles are not objective."
 touhou_news.11.t: "BREAKING NEWS: SPRING DOESN'T WANT TO COME!"
 touhou_news.11.desc: "In Gensokyo, the reports of snowfall during May are still extremely high and there is no sign that spring is coming any time soon! The people fear if the winter remains there will be losses on harvests! Reimu and the other shrine maiden are already informed about this incident and preparing for an investigation. The witch Marisa and the maiden Sakuya are also concerned about this development. According to rumors some kind of dead princess is involved in this incident! IS REMILIA PLANNING TO COVER GENSOKYO WITH SCARLET MIST AGAIN?!"
 touhou_news.12.t: "YUKARI THINKS ABOUT HER OWN GLOBAL EMPIRE!"
 touhou_news.12.desc: "Although the guardian and creator of Gensokyo is very known for her very long naps she has said she would be interested into creating "the British Empire, but Gensokyan"!

 touhou_news.13.t: "PRICE OF GRAIN IS EXPLODING!"
 touhou_news.13.desc: "Yuyuko, the mistress of Netherworld, did it again! Her neverending hunger consumed the grain of an entire season and the price for bread is exploding! Fortunately, she made the following statement: \"What is the matter anyway? Here in Gensokyo we have so much harvest thanks to the Aki Sisters, so the little bit of food I eat cannot hurt the economy...\". We confronted Yuyuko with the newest market price of bread, where she answered she will look outside Gensokyo for food! It is unclear how she will accomplish this goal, but if she satisfies her hunger with food from outside Gensokyo, the price of grain can finally calm down!"
 touhou_news.14.t: "NEW INVENTION: DIPLOMATIC DANMAKU FIGHT!"
 touhou_news.14.desc: "\"The years of solitude are finally over!\" were the thoughts of the girl of destruction when she presented her innovative idea to the world! Flandre Scarlet has recently developed a new way of holding Gensokyo's legendary Danmaku Fights: the \"Diplomatic Danmaku Fight\"! Thanks to her newest invention people can finally play together without the fear of hurting each other - and this pleases humans as well as little vampires likewise! This new technique is already used by Marisa, Yukari and Yuyuko, but will this ever replace the normal danmakus? ONLY THE FUTURE WILL TELL!"
 touhou_news.20.t: "BREAKING NEWS: ALIEN VISITS AND FALSE MAPS!"
 touhou_news.20.desc: "It was a peaceful night. There were no signs for an abnormal observation. But then strange red and blue dots were noticed in the night sky! According to experts, they weren't neither danmaku projectiles nor any known Gensokyan flying in the sky! The humans are afraid, the youkai don't get any rest and even here on the Youkai Mountains we tengu can't get an eye closed since then. Neither the Hakurei Shrine nor the Witch from the Magic of Forest want to say anything about this event. But the appearance of strange dots in the sky weren't the only curious things that happened to Gensokyo! Cartographers noticed this morning that many known places of Gensokyo have been moved and even a huge river appeared in Gensokyo! HAVE ALIENS ALTERED OUR HOMELAND?! YOU WILL KNOW CONCLUSION IN THE NEXT NEWSPAPER!"
 touhou_news.30.t: "BREAKING NEWS: FAKE MOON! FAKE MOON!"
 touhou_news.30.desc: "It is only a sliver - a little defect in the light. Something that a normal human wouldn't be able to see the difference. But the many local youkai notice this - and this very badly! The Moon, a long friend of our lovely world we call Earth, is FAKE! The light it emits is only an illusion! And worst thing is: it makes the many weaker youkai of Gensokyo go mad! When the sun sets, the fake moonlight gets mixed with the sunlight, which causes many once so beloved youkai to go insane! There were already reports of rampaging youkai in the Bamboo Forest! IS THIS THE WORK OF ALIENS WHO TRY TO DESTROY GENSOKYO? OR DID DRUNK ONI DESTROY THE MOON AND REPLACED IT WITH A FAKE ONE? BUNBUNMARU NEWS WILL LET YOU KNOW OF THE TRUTH!"
 touhou_news.31.t: "FIRE IN THE BAMBOO FOREST!"
 touhou_news.31.desc: "A massive fire broke out in  the Bamboo forest! Information around this fire is hard to find, but your tengu news team did find them anyway! According to eye and bun witnesses the fire is a product of a fight, which plagues the Bamboo Forest since an eternity: the war between Kaguya Houraisan, a mysterious yet extremely beautiful lady, and Fujiwara no Mokou, a strange girl who likes to lit herself! They've been rivals since both arrived in Gensokyo. Although they both have the highest number of murder attempts at each other, none of them is actually dead! A strange surprise, but a welcome one as Mokou is extremely popular with the other Eientei habitants as well as a good friend with the Human Capital! The Human Capital would suffer a huge loss should Mokou ever die - and our tengu will be the first to let you know if this ever happens!"
 touhou_news.32.t: "MYSTERIES OF THE MOON!"
 touhou_news.32.desc: "Because of the changes in the night sky we asked somebody, who was on the Moon a millennium ago, for information about this mysterious phenomenon in the sky: Yukari Yakumo!\n\"Ms. Yakumo, can you tell us something about the Moon?\"\n\"Sure, Ms. Shameimaru. The Moon is a dangerous and lifeless rock, filled with crazy people, who would like to enslave simple people like you and me.\"\n\"This is worrisome. Do they want to attack us?\"\n\"Currently not, but I wouldn't be surprised if they decide to do so one day. They have a very strong defense, but you shouldn't underestimate their Moon Rabbit soldiers. Although in the Lunarian eyes the most expensive thing of a Rabbit soldier is their weapon, they are still fearsome warriors, who would kill tengu like you without a blink. My advice is to keep your guards on all the time.\"\n\"Those are some really worrisome news. Do you think the change in the sky is a product of those Lunarians, Ms. Yakumo?\"\n\"Possible. I recognize the magic of this and it is Lunarian nature. But why would the Lunarians want to hide themselves from Gensokyo? Well, either way, my good friend Reimu and I will solve this. You have not to worry, little bird.\"\n\"Thank you for your time, Ms. Yakumo.\""
 touhou_news.33.t: "SEVERAL LEADERS ARE ANNOUNCING THEIR FOCUSES!"
 touhou_news.33.desc: "Since the day it was revealed that the maps were wrong a lot of new clans and nations found their way to the map of Gensokyo! For a long time it was unknown what exactly their ambitions may have been - until today! We just got the message, that all the new leaders have gathered in the neutral Human Capital and announced their ideas, their traditions and especially their ambitions! Special mentions go to a crazed engineer who yelled about \"tanks\" for several hours and the fairies, who decided to try a new life as pirates! What will this bring to Gensokyo? And are fairy pirates the future?! \"Great! Now my freaking mansion will be raided every day!\", complains Remilia Scarlet regarding that news. Experts are unsure how this announcement will change the balance of power in Gensokyo!"
 touhou_news.40.t: "BACK IN BUSINESS - AGAIN!"
 touhou_news.40.desc: "For everyone who has read the first article months ago this title will look quite familiar, but now the newspaper is back! However, this time we have another story, why the newspaper came delayed: in recent times, we Tengu had internal struggle with some newcomers and disputes about religions - the classic stuff. But the Bunbunmaru News had also some problems with some really, really zealous shrine maidens and their profit oriented goddess. Of course I won't mention names this time too, but be assured: we from the Bunbunmaru News will never put true facts and stories behind profit! With that said that said, have fun with the news of this month and last month!\n - Shameimaru Aya\n\n\n*The next five pages are filled with random advertisement of Kappa inventions, which are definitely built with profit in mind*"
 touhou_news.41.t: "BREAKING NEWS: A NEW SHRINE OPENS!"
 touhou_news.41.desc: "For a very long time only the Hakurei Shrine was the anchor point for spiritual and religious guidance in Gensokyo - and this was true even waaaay back when the Shrine was still located in the North! But this is about to change! The new Moriya Shrine, right next to our humble newspaper production hub, has officially opened and started their campaign to get more followers! However, rumors have arrived that they also want to close Reimu's dearest shrine and eliminate them as their only competition. HOW WILL THE SHRINE MAIDEN REIMU HAKUREI REACT TO THIS AND WILL GENSOKYO FALL INTO A RELIGIOUS TURMOIL? ONLY THE FUTURE MIGHT SHOW THE ANSWERS!"
 touhou_news.42.t: "MORIYA SHRINE PLANS FOR GENSOKYO"
 touhou_news.42.desc: "Speaking of the Moriya Shrine: with their opening they also announced their plans. For this we from the Bunbunmaru News had an interview with their two goddesses: Kanako Yasaka and Suwako Moriya!\nBN: \"Ms. Yasaka-\"\nK:\"Oh, please call me Kanako. I don't like formalities.\"\nS: \"Same here too.\"\nBN: \"Oh, ok. Kanako, can you tell us more about your plans with Gensokyo?\"\nK: \"Sure, Aya. But first some background story: you see, my shrine-\"\nS: *Sarcastic coughing*\nK: \"Excuse me. OUR shrine was originally located in the Outworld. And while we have lost faith as the humans were too busy murdering each other, I have witnessed their technological progression and want to bring it to this lovely land of Gensokyo."\nBN: \"Aha. And what about your religious plans? We heard rumors that you two are trying to reform Gensoykan Shintoism.\"\nS: \"It's actually only Kanako who wants to do this. Personally, I'm just here to see how all of her plans fall apart.\" *laughs*\n K: \"Supportive as ever, Suwako... Anyway, yes, the rumors are true. When we arrived here we saw an extremely wasteful style of Shintoism. All the good faith every god wishes to have just vanishes instead of going to the rightful deity and the main head of this religion doesn't seem to care. So for this we've decided to reform it!\"\nBN: \"I see. Well, sadly the time is over now. I thank you two for your time, Kanako and Suwako.\""

Reimu Hakure explains, that this is only a temporary problem is, but her shrinemate Suika Ibuki speaks of a curse of the Donation Box!!\nFortunately, they are good news from them: it is said that Reimu and Suika have plans to take care of this financial crisis as well as the new religious threat coming from the new Moriya Shrine as well as the Temples in the North. What will they look like though? We don't know! BUT WE WILL REPORT IT TO YOU AS SOON IT GETS REVEALED!"

According to rumors, Yukari gave Flandre the offer to start her own kingdom in the far lands of the West! \"Becoming the Holy Roman Empress is her destiny\" were the words Yukari seemed to have said.

 touhou_news.45.t: "DEMON ACTIVITIES IN THE NORTH!"
 touhou_news.45.desc: "For a long time they were silent, minding their own business. But lately, more and more stories have come to our ears that the demonic residents of Makai - the very servants of the mysterious goddess Shinki - have become quite active recently. Theories are that Shinki had enough of her losing status in Gensokyo and that she wants to become one of the big players again. Others speculate that she is seeking for a new hobby and started collecting maids. ARE THERE ANY TRUTHS TO THESE THEORIES? WE FROM THE BUNBUNMARU NEWS WILL LET YOU KNOW!"
 touhou_news.50.t: "BREAKING NEWS: DANMAKU EVERYWHERE!!"
 touhou_news.50.desc: "The people of Gensokyo were always very motivated to find reasons to bash the skull of the other person with tons and tons of danmaku, but recently the number of Danmaku Fights has reached an all-time high! Be it humans, fairies, oni, youkai or underpaid shrine maidens: everyone is now challenging the other to a danmaku fight for the most silliest reason possible. Even we at the Bunbunmaru News had our fair share of fights too! Fortunately, the newspaper are well protected by our lovable* wolf companions. However, it is only a matter of time until more people want to challenge this reporter to absurd Danmaku Fights! But we will endure for you, dear readers, and print more true and well-written news for you! HOW MANY CHALLENGERS WILL APEAR IN THE FUTURE THOUGH AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GENSOKYO? ONLY TIME WILL TELL!\n\n\n*\"Lovable\" is a clear overestimation and should not be used in combination with a wolf tengu."
 touhou_news.51.t: "LOCALE FAIRY DEMANDS JUST-ICE!"
 touhou_news.51.desc: "Cirno has enough! According to the ice fairy of the Misty Lake, the fairies of Gensokyo have suffered enough under foreign invaders and now she demands JUST-ICE! \"No longer shall my kind serve an evil vampire as maidens! No longer shall my fellow fairies be used as cannon fodders by some stupid bakas!!\" - words of an angry ice fairy. Although she shows serious dedication for her cause, we from the Bunbunmaru News remain skeptical if she can enforce her demands. \"Free Prankcare\", \"Frogs to freeze for everyone\" and \"Retribution against the evil fairy slayers\" were her promises for every fairy, who wants to join forces with her. WILL CIRNO MANAGE TO CAUSE THE FAIRY REVOLUTION OF GENSOKYO OR WILL SHE SERVE REMILIA AS THE NEW REFRIGERATOR? STAY TUNED FOR MORE INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE!"
 touhou_news.52.t: "PIRACY ON THE MISTY LAKE!"

Do you know who could be behind these attacks?\"\nS: \"Ms. Hatate, I must disappoint you, but I do not have an idea who it could be.\"\nBN: \"Could it be somebody from the Scarlet Mansion maybe?\"\nS: \"I beg your pardon, but neither the dear Mistress nor any of her servants is a barbarian. We from the Scarlet Devil Mansion have no connection to these ... savage attacks.\"\nBN: \"Did you hear of any rumors though, which could lead to the culprit?\"\nS: \"Well, the fairy maidens in the mansion speculated that the Three Fairies of Light might be behind these raids. One of them even wished to get unlimited, paid vacations so she can join them. However, we have our doubts that some simple fairies would go so far with their pranks that they operate organized piracy.\"\nBN: \"The fairies have become bolder though - especially after Cirno demanded more rights for fairy kind. What makes you sure that the Three Fairies are not these wanted pirates?\"\nS: \"Ms. Hatate, they are fairies. Even human children in the age of eight have shown a brighter mind than them to say it in a mannered way.\"\nBN: \"I understand. Well then, thank you for your time, Ms. Sakuya.\""

 touhou_news.53.desc: "Not all fairies are mischievous pranksters, who spent their time with stealing and freezing. Some of them are actually even quite nice. Enter Lily White and Eternity Larva! We have spent two days to observe what these two fairies do in their free time and how they help the people of Gensokyo! First, we accompany the spring fairy Lily White!\n*Two whole pages are filled with a collection of Lily yelling \"Spring has come!\" and how humans see her as a symbol of luck*\nAlthough Lily White is a nice person and is well seen, her day is not all too interesting. HOWEVER: the young fairy Eternity Larva has a more interesting job as well as even a backstory worth to be told! The butterfly fairy Eternity has the ability to change the weather and as such we have observed how she turned even the coldest winter day into a hot summer day! She is also the only fairy who has weird memories of the past! Bad memory is not too uncommon for fairy kind, but Eternity reports that she remembers a great fight against the secret goddess Okina Matara and how she was once somebody else! WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ETERNITY LARVA IN THE PAST? AND HOW IS OKINA CONNECTED TO THIS STORY? SUBSCRIBE NOW TO BUNBUNMARU NEWS TO READ THE WHOLE STORY!"

 touhou_news.54.desc: "There is no type of fairies, which is enveloped in mysteries than the infamous hell fairies. According to fairy experts, this kind of fairies used to live in the Forest of Magic like all the other fairies, but then they got an offer from nobody else than Hecatia Lapislazuli - the Goddess of Hell herself! She offered them power and pranks in exchange for their service. Only a fraction of these fairies joined Hecatia then - included the notorious fairy Clownpiece. Ever since we never heard of these hell fairies again until recently! We got the message from the moon rabbit Reisen Udongein Inaba, who told us that the lunarian on the Moon are suffering from the nature effect of \"Moon Fairies\". According to Moon expert Eirin, there are no natural fairies on the Moon, but she made the theory, that hell fairies could have made their way to the moon and embraced the lunarian powers there, making them to some kind of moon fairies. WILL THESE MOON FAIRIES INVADE GENSOKYO IN THE FUTURE? AND HOW OFTEN WILL WE GET THEM MIXED UP? ONLY TIME WILL TELL!"

 touhou_news.56.t: "REIMU AND MARISA LAZING AROUND!"
 touhou_news.56.desc: "Outrageous news: despite their promises, neither Reimu nor Marisa are doing ANYTHING! Both of Gensokyo's famous investigators promised that they will put more focus on their goals in Gensokyo, but at the time these news have been brought to you they are just lazing around, saying that \"there wasn't enough time for balancing their focuses\"! For months they talked about their new plans like meditation about the past, forming an own academy for all magicians of Gensokyo, hunting wild youkai down or doing the greatest theft in all time - but nothing! NOTHING! Yukari claims that the works on Reimu's \"mission tree\" needed to be delayed because of missing time for proper \"balancing\" and that the \"developers\" are too busy with \"exams\". Yukari also claims that the next \"update\" include the new changes to Hakurei Clan and the Forest of Magic! We from the Bunbunmaru News have no ideas what this gap hag was talking, but we know one thing for sure: we are offended! WILL YUKARI BE RIGHT THOUGH IN THE END? WE REMAIN SKEPTICAL!"

Over time it evolved into its own religion and took some aspects of Buddhism and even Taoism, incorporating both to an unique philosophy of life. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName]. As time goes by the Gensokyan identity becomes less and less of an issue and Gensokyan followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

 th_confucian_events.3.d: "Moriya Shintoism is - in contrast to the other Gensokyan religions - relatively new. It was designed as a reformation of Hakurei Shintoism, but it still consists of many parts of Taoism, Buddhism and Japanese Shintoism. As time goes by the Moriya Shintoistic identity becomes less and less of an issue and Moriya followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

 th_confucian_events.4.d: "Taoism is originally a Chinese religion with many parallel to today's Confucian. While it drifted away from its Chinese original, it still contains many teachings of the old philosophy of life, which in turn are essential parts of our religion. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName].

 th_confucian_events.5.d: "The Eastern religion group is ancient and possesses many roots of our religion today, which makes the harmonization of these religions relatively easy. At first the Buddhistic, the Shintoistic and the Confucian didn't accept our new view of religion and philosophy, but as time went by they became more and more integrated in our society. But even our religion adapted to the old ways and integrated the view of gods and karma and confucianism teachings."

 th_confucian_events.6.d: "The old Hakurei Tradition was once the common Hakurei Shintoism in Gensokyo. It shares many similarities with his reformed successor but it was still missing the Spell Card System, which has been a huge part of modern day Gensokyo. Either way, the many followers of this religion have found their place within our nation and adapted to the new Spell Card System while maintaining their icons of the past.  As time goes by the old Hakurei Tradition identity becomes less and less of an issue and Traditional followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

 th_confucian_events.7.d: "Shinkism is viewed by the most Gensokyan as a cult - a heresy, which only allows to worship Shinki, the creator of Makai. Even though Shinkism has abandoned the worship of the other gods of Gensokyo, their principles still are the ones of the Hakurei Traditions, which made their integration in our realm quite easy as the many basics of Buddhism and Shintoism are still found. As time goes by the Shinkistic identity becomes less and less of an issue and Shinkisitic followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

 th_confucian_events.8.d: "Touhou Christianity is unlike any other religion in Gensokyo. According to Gensokyo's inhabitants, Touhou Christianity has its origin in the far west in the Outworld. Fortunately, the strong influence of Gensokyo forced the Touhou Christians to adopt many Shintoistic teachings.  As time goes by the Touhou Christian identity becomes less and less of an issue and Christian followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

There are, however, many local landowners more than ready to infringe on the land an empty monastery would leave behind. As the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is meant to protect Monastic life in [Root.Owner.GetName] it will be clear to many observers that the responsibility for whatever happens will rest on [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] shoulders."

 th_buddhism_events.4.d:0 "While Buddhism of Gensokyo focuses on a life of tolerance and harmony not everyone is able to follow the teachings of Byakuren Hijiri constantly. Shou, the Avatar of Bishamonten is a disciple of Byakuren, but unlike any other disciple she is also mentor of Byakuren. However, both influential persons have two very different views regarding armed conflicts: while the teachings of Byakuren Hijiri forbids to let fury and anger guide us through the time of war, Shou flows in rage and fury to defend her homeland. Now the question remains: which philosophy should we adapt to in these rough times?"

The number of deserters seeking to hide behind the walls of the monasteries is not big but they set a dangerous example. As a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is, however, our duty to protect the monasteries and while we have repeatedly warned them not to accept men like these, it seems some still do."

 th_buddhism_events.11.d:0 "There has been lately a trend, where many Buddhistic people buy themselves idols, which are supposed to bring luck and a step closer to Nirvana. Of course this is complete nonsense, but our local merchants and producers are very happy with this trend as it brings them and us a fortune. However, allowing them to continue to produce and sell those idols our people may move more and more away from the right path."

Though our manpool is dwindling, those new recruits are really young - some even still go to a school! We could use those recruits quite well, but on the other hand it is more ethical to send those young men and women back to their families."

 th_buddhism_events.12.b:0 "We don't have the luxury of being ethical."
 th_buddhism_events.13.t:1 "Popular Novel"
 th_buddhism_events.13.d:1 "A vernacular novel about a well-known story from the [Root.GetOldEra] era is rapidly gaining popularity among our subjects. This in itself is not a problem but it has come to our attention that this novelization is in fact breaking central tenets of Gensokyan-Buddhistic ideology as it could be seen as an argument for causing more conflicts between the humans and youkai.\nOur administrators now argue that the book must be banned, though some fear this will only make it more alluring to those that wish to read it."

 th_buddhism_events.14.t:1 "Civil Service"
 th_buddhism_events.14.d:1 "Education, self-improvement and adherence to the classics are the backbone of Gensokyan-Buddhistic government and if our [Root.GovernmentName] is to aspire to greatness we must at all times devote money, attention and energy to ensuring that our officials are as well educated and well informed as they can possibly be. It is therefore of some concern that the number of people seeking government employment seem to be decreasing as of late."

 th_buddhism_events.16.d:0 "The local aristocracy in [Root.GetName] seems to have been growing quite powerful over the last few years. While we retain nominal control over the area much of the real power lies with the local landowners who have been known to grow their domains at the expense of monastery land. This practice, along with other excesses may well be used against them but in order to achieve the full effect we would probably need to embellish the truth a little. There are those who would be willing to do just that for us in exchange for nice positions in our administration afterwards."

The local population is growing and claiming new land at a speed that the current infrastructure does not support. The representative also asks that the state supply food to those who need it in the meantime.\nWhile this project would have few downsides besides the cost, there are currently no plans to improve this particular region and doing so in a reasonable time would likely be quite expensive."

 th_buddhism_events.23.t:0 "Inheritance"
 th_buddhism_events.23.d:0 "A conflict has arisen in one of the more influential monasteries of [Root.GetName] after the death of a monk. The monk in question came from a very influential lay family and during his time in robes, he had managed to acquire a rich set of valuable manuscripts and an assortment of Buddha images and other things. While monks cannot own property, the law still allows for a dedicated disciple to inherit these things and be considered as a son to the monk. In this case a young disciple has taken care of the monk as he lay at his end. There are, however, others interested, the monastery itself has argued that they should get the inheritance and would likely be very thankful for support in this matter. The lay family of the monk have also approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] hoping to inherit not only the manuscripts and images but also some of the land they have donated to the monastery while their family member was part of it."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] is furious and while there can be some doubt as to if the slight was deliberate or not the public clearly sees it as such.\nIf we do not publicly condemn the ambassador we risk losing face, the council of ministers, however, urge caution."

 th_buddhism_events.30.d:0 "It is with great pleasure that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has watched some of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] close friends climb the state hierarchy but now this has made us the target of accusations of favoritism. The local governor of [Root.GetName] has been singled out by these accusations and the situation would undoubtedly be defused by replacing him no matter how competent he has been on that post."

 TH_shinto_events.1.t: "Time for a New Deity"
 TH_shinto_events.1.desc: "The Shinto religion of Gensokyo is different from its ancestor in Japan. In Gensokyo the gods gain faith through personal deities. In order to please every god the deities will switch about every 10 years."

 TH_shinto_events.7.desc: "It is a common Gensokyan tradition to visit a shrine and give a donation, and it has come time to do so. We can either give a small donation at a local shrine, give a large donation at one of the two most popular shrines or not go to a shrine at all."

 th_deity_events.1.t: "Promising Shrine Maiden"
 th_deity_events.1.desc: "One of our young shrine maidens, who swore to serve the Hakurei God, showed great potential in religious as well as fighting matters. She declared herself ready to assist us in our deity's name."
 th_deity_events.1.a: "She should organize our missionaries."
 th_deity_events.1.b: "Her fighting skills will be a great asset at the front."
 th_deity_events.1.c: "The shrine maiden will support our ships with her danmakus."
 th_deity_events.2.t: "Hakurei Festival"
 th_deity_events.2.desc: "The Hakurei festival is a tradition, which started in the Hakurei Shrine. Several youkai, humans, ghosts and what not gather at the shrine to celebrate with the Maiden about their glorious duels in the past. The location for the festival, however, is not set to be at the Hakurei Shrine, which means that every pious Hakurei nation can hold this festival - and this year we have the honor to organize it."
 th_deity_events.2.a: "Let's make us the biggest festival Gensokyo has ever seen!"
 th_deity_events.2.b: "We should spend a little bit of money for a good party."
 th_deity_events.2.c: "Ehh... Not really worth it. Let's make a small part."
 th_deity_events.2.d: "Like any other day at the Hakurei Shrine..."
 th_deity_events.3.t: "Lucky Year"
 th_deity_events.3.desc: "Reports from our cities say that this year, extremely few accidents have happened. It seems like our whole realm has been blessed by the Hakurei God and enjoys now a time of luck and fortune - well, except for the donation box."
 th_deity_events.3.a: "Truly a blessed year."
 th_deity_events.3.b: "If only the donation box was blessed…"
 th_deity_events.4.t: "Shrine Maidens visit [Root.GetName]"
 th_deity_events.4.desc: "Some Shrine Maidens and professional Youkai Hunters have visited our realm. They are zealous followers of the Hakurei God deity and when they saw our people worshipping the Hakurei God, they felt like they were home.\nSome days later they made an appearance at the court and wished to show our army some tricks and tips for danmaku battles. With a little engagement from our military advisors, we could even convince them to stay longer for better training."
 th_deity_events.4.a: "We should keep them a little longer."
 th_deity_events.4.b: "We don't have the means for a longer training."
 th_deity_events.5.t: "A Special Gift"
 th_deity_events.5.desc: "So, you have chosen me as your deity, haven't you? Well, that's a little bit unexpected. Usually the gods of Gensokyo get all the attention. Oh well, then I should reward you. How about you tell me what you desire and I will get you something to fulfill this wish..."
 th_deity_events.5.a: "My realm could use a strong military."
 th_deity_events.5.b: "A little bit money wouldn't hurt."
 th_deity_events.5.c: "Can I have some vacations please?"
 th_deity_events.5.d: "I could need a little help in inner diplomacy."

 th_deity_events.6.t: "Zashiki-Warashi"
 th_deity_events.6.desc: "I see your people are worshipping me and trying to appeal me with faith. I am not a god, but I appreciate it.\nHmm... I guess in return I will allow you to use my special spies and diplomats, the Zashiki-Warashis. Take good care of them."
 th_deity_events.6.a: "Thank you, Yukari."
 th_deity_events.7.t: "Spies out of the Gaps"
 th_deity_events.7.desc: "My spies found some ... totally formal correct and approved documents, that this province from [th_hkr_shinto_target_country.GetName] actually belongs to [Root.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.7.a: "Neat."
 th_deity_events.8.t: "An unlikely Quartet"
 th_deity_events.8.desc: "Time, space, dimensions - those are concepts which are not easy to explain for a mortal. But I refuse to think that it is important for you to understand it. More importantly to know is that four souls had it pretty bad in their life and got ... well, what do you people call it nowadays? \"Isekai'd\"? Anyway, there are now four guys, who now found their ways through one of my gaps now into Gensokyo. You can have one of those four very promising people. I will keep the other three for my own court."
 th_deity_events.8.a: "The man who dies often sounds like a fun person."
 th_deity_events.8.b: "I take the one who truly stands for gender equality."

 th_deity_events.8.e: "Yukari... you know, that THIS is your court, right?"
 th_deity_events.8.e.tt: "Oh, right. Well, then of course we take all four of them."
 th_deity_events.9.t: "Hecatia, Mistress of Hell"
 th_deity_events.9.desc: "Hecatia is not only the patron of impressive fashion sense, but also the mistress of Hell. As our realm focuses more and more on the worship of her, they also get more and more scared of being sent to hell.\nThis fear increases a lot more when news comes from provinces, which were held by rebel scum, that the occupiers all got banished into oblivion. It seems like our deity is protecting our realm."
 th_deity_events.9.a: "She may be mistress of Hell, but she is also our Guardian Angel."
 th_deity_events.10.t: "Three Body Aspects"
 th_deity_events.10.desc: "Hecatia is a benevolent and supporting deity and stands for her followers. But she also helps outside times of great need. Her ability - splitting into the three divine entities, which represent the forces holding Gensokyo together - allows her to be active at multiple places at once. Hecatia is so friendly and allows us to pick one of her three bodies to serve our realm."
 th_deity_events.10.a: "I choose the Earth Aspect."
 th_deity_events.10.b: "I choose the Moon Aspect."
 th_deity_events.10.c: "I choose the Otherworld Aspect."
 th_deity_events.11.t: "The Eccentricities of Hecatia"
 th_deity_events.11.desc: "Unlike the other gods of Gensokyo, Hecatia is a little bit ... unique when it comes down to luxuries and especially fashion. And even though money is not a problem for her, it has become a little tradition to collect money to support her fashion choices. Of course this is a complete optional donation, but pious followers of Hecatia would appreciate this gift to her just as much as she does."
 th_deity_events.11.a: "Well, I think a little bit of money to appeal the followers is ok."
 th_deity_events.11.b: "Oh, optional you say? Fine by me."
 th_deity_events.11.c: "Hey, my fashion sense isn't THAT expensive..."
 th_deity_events.12.t: "Rule of Authority"
 th_deity_events.12.desc: "Hell is a harsh place and only the strongest and the most cunning can reign supreme over the other residents of Hell. As a result of this, the leader of this place must show their absolute power either on their own or through their army. A concept which is true in the normal realms of Gensokyo too."
 th_deity_events.12.a: "I am the Authority over my court!"
 th_deity_events.12.b: "I am the Authority over my army!"
 th_deity_events.13.t: "Fort Backdoors"
 th_deity_events.13.desc: "At first our soldiers thought they were dreaming. Hallucinating. But when they practiced the sieging of a fort, they noticed a magical door at the back of the practice castle, which allowed them to take it way faster. Apparently, this door isn't specific to this very castle but to every fortified province our soldiers visit. It is like Okina herself wants us to occupy any fortress our army will have to deal with."
 th_deity_events.13.a: "With those backdoors not many forts can withstand us!"
 th_deity_events.14.t: "The many Secrets of the Court"
 th_deity_events.14.desc: "The court of [Root.GetName] houses [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s closest advisors. However, not all advisors act in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] interests, but in their own. Plots and intrigues are very common in the court. To our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s luck, Okina knows exactly which parts of the court have the most dangerous secrets. One of her backup dancers is offering us one of the three plots of the estates."
 th_deity_events.14.a: "Tell me about the taboos of the shrine maidens."
 th_deity_events.14.b: "Tell me about the secrets of the human guilds."
 th_deity_events.14.c: "Tell me about the intrigues of the youkai."
 th_deity_events.14.d: "I know many secrets..."
 th_deity_events.15.t: "Dancing Explorer"
 th_deity_events.15.desc: "Okina is not a goddess with few followers, but with close - yet dispensable - advisors: her Backup Dancers. But they are not forever useful for her and when the dancers overstay their welcome in Okina's realm, they get replaced. However, instead of just getting them rid, our deity noticed our people's deity and decided to give [Root.GetName]'s court her redundant, but quite curious dancer. It is up to us of how we shall use her."
 th_deity_events.15.a: "This dancer should help us out in our colonies."
 th_deity_events.15.b: "She will do a fine job as an explorer."
 th_deity_events.15.c: "She should use her curiosity in the New World."
 th_deity_events.16.t: "Open Door to a new Province!"
 th_deity_events.16.desc: "It appears that our colonial engagement drew our deity's attention. The idea of us discovering the secrets of the New World appeals to Okina! She decided to give us a little bit of support and opened two doors: one goes to completely new, unclaimed land, the other leads us to our already existing colony. Which door should our colonists step through?"
 th_deity_events.16.a: "Let them take the door to the new province."
 th_deity_events.16.b: "Guide them to our existing colony."
 th_deity_events.17.t: "Gift of the Aki Sisters"
 th_deity_events.17.desc: "The Aki Sisters are benevolent goddesses, who have only so many followers and support. Because of this, they appreciate any support they get way more than any other deity. This year, their harvest was exceptionally well and made them a considerable profit. Now they are selling it and sharing the money with the people, who donate their faith for them."
 th_deity_events.17.a: "That's so nice of them!"
 th_deity_events.18.t: "Aki Sisters bless our Crops"
 th_deity_events.18.desc: "Because of their small group of followers, the Aki Sisters have more time and energy to give to the very few who have chosen them as their deities - those few include us as well. As thanks, they came personally to our farmers and blessed their crops!"
 th_deity_events.18.a: "Blessed be their hearts!"
 th_deity_events.19.t: "The Aki Sisters' Experiences"
 th_deity_events.19.desc: "Both, Shizuha and Minoriko are goddesses, who have lived more lives than any human and most of the youkai. These experiences of so many years combined with their relative long downtime outside autumn both sisters can share their wisdom regarding harvest organization, fertility, calm mindsets and what not."
 th_deity_events.19.a: "Tell me more about the secrets of fertility..."
 th_deity_events.19.b: "[Root.Heir.GetName] will greatly benefit from their experiences."
 th_deity_events.19.c: "A calm mindset sure sounds useful."
 th_deity_events.20.t: "Beauty of Fall"
 th_deity_events.20.desc: "This year's Fall season is a beautiful spectacle of colourful leaves - especially in [th_hkr_shinto_target_province.GetName]. The magic of the Aki Sisters motivated many pilgrims to wander and settle in [th_hkr_shinto_target_province.GetName] now."
 th_deity_events.20.a: "Nice."
 th_deity_events.20.b: "Fall is indeed the best season."
 th_deity_events.21.t: "Junko's Fury"
 th_deity_events.21.desc: "No other deity is more violent, vengeful and angry than Junko - aspects which can describe our people quite well during these times of war. The question however is, if we should follow her example and embrace her fury or try to maintain the teachings of Hakurei Shintoism and keep a calm head."
 th_deity_events.21.a: "Dire times require dire actions."
 th_deity_events.21.b: "No. We shouldn't let fury consume our mind."
 th_deity_events.22.t: "Purification"
 th_deity_events.22.desc: "Reports have been made from a province that Junko is personally visiting them to do a Purification..."
 th_deity_events.22.a: "Hopefully, its meaning is better than it sounds like..."
 th_deity_events.23.t: "Purge within the Army"
 th_deity_events.23.desc: "Our deity Junko is fighting an endless war against the Lunarian on the moon - and for this task she only needs the best of the best of warriors she can get. To achieve this goal she developed a system involving her purifying ability to purge her army from the weak. Apparently, this cruel act found its way into the heads of our generals, who are now considering the same to increase the army quality. But in the end, it is [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decision."
 th_deity_events.23.a: "Purge the weak!"
 th_deity_events.23.b: "Only the strongest shall serve!"
 th_deity_events.23.c: "That's a little too brutal - even for an army..."
 th_deity_events.24.t: "Chinese Legacy"
 th_deity_events.24.desc: "Junko wasn't always a deity of Gensokyo. Before she purified her existence, she was known as the wife of an emperor of the ancient Xia-Dynasty in China. But this was a thing of the past. Now she brought her Chinese Legacy - the high art of warfare and the concept of the Mandate of Heaven - to Gensokyo and to all of those, who follow her."
 th_deity_events.24.a: "We will honor this legacy."
 th_deity_events.25.t: "Motherly Affection"
 th_deity_events.25.desc: "Even though Junko is mostly known as the deity of vengeance and wrath, she is also the patron of family and mothers. In a way, she has become a symbol of hope for families, whose fathers and sons are in wars and it is due to the worship of Junko, what gives them the strength to withstand those hard times."
 th_deity_events.25.a: "Junko's blessing upon the families."
 th_deity_events.26.t: "Power of the Word"
 th_deity_events.26.desc: "Sagume Kishin is a powerful being, whose ability is to let the reverse of any possible event happen when she mentions it. It's a very dangerous ability if used without any thought, but in the right hands it can bring massive benefits. Those, who worship Kishin, have a chance to get to enjoy her power for a brief moment - only enough time to say one word, which manipulates our country's fate."
 th_deity_events.26.a: "Poverty."
 th_deity_events.26.b: "Shipwreck."
 th_deity_events.27.t: "Strangers from another World"
 th_deity_events.27.desc: "Some weird strangers once visited our nation. When they saw the might of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy as well as the sailors' piety towards Kishin they decided to visit [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s court to meet with our admirals. Apparently, those strangers are Lunarians, who got banished from their home and now seek a new purpose, where their knowledge of Lunarian naval warfare can be useful again."
 th_deity_events.27.a: "They will be from great benefit for our navy."
 th_deity_events.28.t: "The Art of Communication"
 th_deity_events.28.desc: "Due to our people worshipping Sagume Kishin, the goddess of few words, they got inspired by her thoughtfulness of choosing the right words. Many of our merchants started to become quick-witted in her honor and their skills in trading have been improving a lot since. The Burghers are more than happy with this development."
 th_deity_events.28.a: "Less is more."
 th_deity_events.29.t: "The Silent Way"
 th_deity_events.29.desc: "In recent times our people have become a lot less ... vocal about their problems. It seems like everyone found a way to get their quiet and peaceful life."
 th_deity_events.29.a: "Let's hope it stays this way."
 th_deity_events.30.t: "Inspired Architects"
 th_deity_events.30.desc: "With the adoption of Shinki as our official deity, her indirect influence over our country grew. Especially in the topic of architecture. Many architects and builders are interested in using the Makaian architecture for our buildings. However, they will need some support from the government if their dream should become true."
 th_deity_events.30.a: "Of course they get our support."
 th_deity_events.30.b: "We don't have the resources for it."
 th_deity_events.31.t: "Shinki's Scripts"
 th_deity_events.31.desc: "It is commonly known that Shinki's realm, Makai, was created completely from scratch by Shinki. However, it is a mystery how exactly she did - until one day, a witch came to our shrines with scripts and plans. Although they don't explain how her power of creation exactly works, they give a great insight into the calculations and planning Shinki did for her realm."
 th_deity_events.31.a: "[Root.GetName] will greatly benefit from this."
 th_deity_events.32.t: "[Root.GetName] gets flooded by Makaian Gas!"
 th_deity_events.32.desc: "The province [Root.GetName], which is currently under siege, reports of a strange mist filling the city! It comes from the shrines and it affects only the enemy in our land! It can only be caused by our deity Shinki, who wants to protect us!"
 th_deity_events.32.a: "Praised be Shinki!"
 th_deity_events.33.t: "Shinki's Influence grows in [Root.GetName]!"
 th_deity_events.33.desc: "At first it seemed everything normal at the shrine of [Root.GetName]. But after a closer look it is apparent that there are a lot of idols of Shinki and her creations not only in the shrine but also in the town too! It is said that those idols bring luck to them and increase their inspiration in the business of our government. If we let them continue they will bring a lot of good ideas. However, the province will most likely fall under Shinki's religious control."
 th_deity_events.33.a: "Only new ideas can bring our country further."
 th_deity_events.33.b: "We must stop Shinki's influence!"
 th_deity_events.34.t: "Workshop ideas for [Root.GetName]"
 th_deity_events.34.desc: "Keiki, the deity of the worker and craftsmen, has gained a lot of popularity in our realm. In her honor, a group of artists, craftsmen and shrine maidens got the idea to build an idol workshop in [Root.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.34.a: "Sounds good to me."
 th_deity_events.34.b: "There resources are better used somewhere else."
 th_deity_events.35.t: "Idol Soldiers join the Army!"
 th_deity_events.35.desc: "Our deity Keiki noticed our devotion to her. As thanks for the faith she gathers from our people, she sent a battalion of idol soldiers to join our army!"
 th_deity_events.35.a: "Great!"
 th_deity_events.36.t: "Lectures of Keiki"
 th_deity_events.36.desc: "Keiki fights for the human spirits, which are trapped in the Beastial Hell. Due to the constant warfare and authority system of Hell, Keiki developed a system, which allows her to increase her realm's glory by increasing her power grip on the provinces. Although it sounds bad, the human spirits are more appealed by the idea of being ruled by Keiki than under the beasts.\nThe design of this rule is written down in lectures, which somehow found their way in the hands of one of our Shrine Maidens. She donated those lectures to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for the future of [Root.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.36.a: "I will use those lectures wisely."
 th_deity_events.37.t: "Mayumi's Army"
 th_deity_events.37.desc: "A Haniwa with a great battalion of Haniwa soldiers marched through our country. But they didn't come as invaders. They were led by Mayumi Joutouguu and heard of our people's support for Keiki. She offers us her and her troops services."
 th_deity_events.37.a: "Well, I gladly take this offer."
 th_deity_events.37.b: "I have to decline. Sorry, Mayumi."
 th_deity_events.37.c: "Offer? Mayumi, did you forget that you serve me already?"
 th_deity_events.38.t: "Misfortune of War"
 th_deity_events.38.desc: "War... War never changes. While the way of how a war is fought may vary over the years the horrors and destruction it brings never changes. It is a time of death and great misfortune. Luckily, our deity Hina Kagiyama likes to collect the misfortune of our people and bring hope for a better future."
 th_deity_events.38.a: "Hina blesses us."
 th_deity_events.39.t: "Visit from Hina"
 th_deity_events.39.desc: "Hina isn't used to people who donate their faith and follow her way. Due to this, Hina decided to visit us and thank us personally. She wants to show her appreciation by offering us to use her ability to free one aspect of [Root.GetName] from bad luck."
 th_deity_events.39.a: "Our administrators could use some better luck."
 th_deity_events.39.b: "Our diplomats could use some better luck."
 th_deity_events.39.c: "Our warriors could use some better luck."
 th_deity_events.40.t: "Spinning Festival"
 th_deity_events.40.desc: "The Spinning Festival is a traditional festival from the Youkai forest, where the youkai enjoy their time with Hina and feast upon the stockpiled misfortune. This year, the festival will be held in [Root.Capital.GetName]."
 th_deity_events.40.a: "You spin me right round, baby..."
 th_deity_events.40.a.tt: "Every devastated province loses 10 devastation."
 th_deity_events.41.t: "An insane Suggestion"
 th_deity_events.41.desc: "Our overzealous Shrine Maiden got lately an insane idea: in order to collect more faith for Hina and her shrine she asked us to inflict misfortune on our people. We can cause more misfortune by forcing more people to join our forces, taxing the burghers or making the practices in the army more sadistic. However, it is obvious that this shrine maiden doesn’t have the best mental health."
 th_deity_events.41.a: "We need more soldiers anyway..."
 th_deity_events.41.b: "We could press more money out of the burghers while we're at it."
 th_deity_events.41.c: "More sadistic discipline actions should help."
 th_deity_events.41.d: "She is insane! Send this Shrine maiden into exile!"
 th_deity_events.42.t: "Sanae's Fans"
 th_deity_events.42.desc: "Our recruit master couldn't believe his eyes when this happened: Many young men have enlisted themselves in our army very recently! Apparently, somebody spread the rumor that Sanae Kochiya, our current deity, would love to go out with a tough man and now a horde of men want to prove themselves by becoming soldiers."
 th_deity_events.42.a: "Well, I won't complain, but becoming a soldier for a girl's heart..."
 th_deity_events.42.b: "Oh oh... those are a lot of fans..."
 th_deity_events.42.c: "Send them back to their mommies. We don't need them in our army!"
 th_deity_events.43.t: "A Miracle occurs!"
 th_deity_events.43.desc: "Our country is devastated by war and our government is close to the collapse. Everyone seems to be about to lose hope for a better future - until one night. On this night many of our people saw a green light in the sky. And as its light reached them their wounds got healed, their worries overcome!"
 th_deity_events.43.a: "Kochiya blesses us!"
 th_deity_events.44.t: "Wonders of Modernization"
 th_deity_events.44.desc: "The Moriya religion is a modern take on the rather stoic Gensokyan Shintoism. It brings many new ideas from the outworld and even technology. But due to resources being rather limited for this technology only a few can enjoy the modernization caused by Kochiya and her close advisors. Luckily, we are one of those few countries who receives the gift of technology."

Because of this, our engineers and soldiers pay a lot of attention to keep the fort running. In their last check-up, however, they noticed something strange: the walls of the fort got a new, incredibly hard layer of defense made out of stone and earth.

 TH_mry_shinto_events.28.desc: "Higan is home of the eager yamas and administrators of hell, but it's also the place of Hecatia Lapislazuli, the mistress of Hell. For Hecatia and her servants they don't care much about religious conflicts and only want to fulfil their service. This laid-backness is very similar to Suwako's personality, which is why now both Hecatia and Suwako come along quite well."

When the day came and Kanako made her the offer to side with Moriya, Shinki hesitated, but accepted Kanako's offer. She doesn't like to be under any other body's religious command, but if she had to she would rather follow somebody competent."

The monasteries compete to attract the most educated masters and maintain them with great honor and monetary compensation. In return, the scholars pass on their knowledge to their students, which consist of potential clergymen as well as ambitious nobles. To join the Christian elite, being part of a powerful family is rarely enough – everyone who has a significant role in the running of our country has been educated at one of the most prestigious monastic schools.\n\nWe have been contacted by two of these schools and they are asking for our support.

 ###EVENTS FOR SHINKISM###

 th_shinkism_events.1.desc: "The times have changed in Gensokyo. Where once the goddess Shinki once played a great role in Gensokyo's fate, she now has nearly no place on the stage. But not only has Shinki fallen in oblivion, but also the other powerful figures of the North. And as a result of the invading Moriya religion, the Hakurei Tradition has become a rigid, outdated religion. Shinki, the goddess of Makai, has had enough of this!\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of religion. A religion with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as its Supreme Deity, a happy union of the Shrine and the state. Neither Moriya, Hakurei, nor any other foreign religion, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.\n\nSuch a cult would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority and the people would worship a god, who is actually in charge of Makai."

Of freaking course.\" You groaned loudly. \"How the hell could I have not seen this coming?! Of course Mokou had to go to one of my festivals and talk with some foreign diplomats.\" Your voice becomes more angry and you even punch on your desk, scaring Reisen in the next room. \"AND SHE HAD TO PRESENT HERSELF AS OUR DIPLOMAT AND JUST MAKE EVER MISTAKE YOU COULD DO WITH DIPLOMATS! No, Mokou, it is not very lady-like to show your powers by burning the man's clothes. And no, eating the entire buffet empty is just another blunder... Seriously, you want to be called a princess, but when you behave like this the only thing you are is a pig!!\" You breathe deeply. \"Calm down, Kaguya. Anger is not a solution here. Now, how do I deal with our lost reputation?\""
 th_states_flavor_con.10.fuj_desc: "\"KAAAAAAAAAAAAGUUUUUUUUYAAAAAAAAAA!!!\" you scream really loudly into the air. The air around bursts in fire, but then you become calmer ...to the best of your abilities. \"This. Annoying. Daughter. Of. A. Hoe!! HOW DARES SHE TO TALK MAD STUFF ABOUT ME AT A FESTIVAL! I never, never, NEVER touched any boys, who got lost in the Bamboo Forest. This is straight up an evil lie! I. WILL. KILL. HER FOR THIS!\" You cast a heavy fireball into the air, which explodes just above in your face. \"Oh cra-\" You dodge it just barely. \"Ouch... I will feel this tomorrow too...

Still, Mokou just can't start going in flames and not expect that the Bamboo Forest catches this fire... and now Tewi cried a river, because the fire killed a bunch of bunnies now.\" You roll your eyes with annoyance at this thought. \"This will cost so much money to get this stuff repaired...\""
 th_states_flavor_con.11.fuj_desc: "\"What. The Hell?!\" You look horrified at a piece of paper. It is a bill Kaguya sent you. \"She spent HOW much money?! By the gods, this girl's lifestyle... spending hundreds of Ducats for cosmetical stuff...\" You look into the mirror. \"Pfff... wasting money on your look. Maybe Kaguya isn't the <natural beauty> everyone is thinking of her after all!\" You start to laugh quietly at the thought, that her entire look is based on cosmetics. \"Anyways, I know she won't clear those bills off.

Ehh, did you order this rule, mistress?\" You answer: \"Nope. Mokou did this. She managed to gather enough people to enforce this crap as a national rule. I must admit, she is creative.\""

This is really tasteless - even for you Kaguya...\" You put the newspaper aside as suddenly your good friend Keine appears. \"Hey Mokou, is everything alright?\" \"Well... apparently I enacted a rule, which forces people in the Bamboo Forest to only walk on one foot and to talk backwards.\" \"Uhhh?! When did this happen? Did you really-\" \"Of course not, Keine. But I am pretty sure Kaguya is the culprit behind this.

 th_education_events.4.fairy.desc: "Fairies aren't really good talkers. They prefer to do stuff instead. But in a world where everyone can declare you a war because your words were misunderstood as insults, it is better to have someone who can speak for the fairies. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to fulfill this role, but unfortunately [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] isn't the most skilled diplomat. To change this our ruler has to speak with other rulers - even if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will embarrass [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]..."

But they were mostly used like mercenaries and never had a real training. [Root.Monarch.GetName] desires to change this and tries to make [Root.GetName]'s troops into a professional army. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] lacks the knowledge how to train, which means [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has to experiment with the many training methods..."

A series of tasks, challenges, pranks and duels, which shall show who is the Strongest, Wisest and Quickest Fairy of Gensokyo!"
