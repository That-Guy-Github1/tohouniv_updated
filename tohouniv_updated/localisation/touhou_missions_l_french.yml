 HKR_discover_europe_desc:0 "A lot of time has passed since the Breaking of the Hakurei Barrier and a lot of foreigners have come to Gensokyo. Fortunately they are usually peaceful traders and no threat to our homeland at all. But their stories of a rich continent, where dozens of clashing religions and diverse cultures made a lot of our people curious. We should explore the far west and see if their stories are true."

 HKR_scarlet_mist_incident_desc:0 "The first major incident, the Scarlet Mist Incident, was created by Remilia with her red fog, which blocks all sunlight.

 HKR_eternal_night_incident_title:0 "Eternal Night Incident"
 HKR_eternal_night_incident_desc:0 "An usual night. Or at least an usual night in the eyes of a human. But for the youkai it is incredible nerve-wrenching night as the Moon, which usually shines over the Gensokyo is replaced with nothing but an imitation. This was the rumored Eternal Night Incident, caused by Lunarian princess, who tried to hide from her people from the moon. To the youkai's appeal the fake Moon didn't persist for long as the princess got defeated."

 HKR_control_over_the_tree_title:0 "Control over Saigyou Ayakashi"
 HKR_control_over_the_tree_desc:0 "In the Netherwold lives a demonic cherry blossom tree, which attracts many people to their death. While it is sealed by the ghost princess Yuyuko herself it is still a great danger for everyone - and the fact that Yuyuko also has to rule over a realm doesn't help the seal. We should take control over this dangerous tree and reinforce the seals with Hakurei spells."
 HKR_convert_the_human_capital_title:0 "Convert the Human Capital"
 HKR_convert_the_human_capital_desc:0 "The humans in the Human Capital, the heart of Gensokyo, are kindhearted, but they follow a heretic religion from old times. These Buddhistic minds stray them from the Gensokyan gods and corrupt even more people. We should stop this heresy immediately."
 HKR_stop_the_taoistic_heresy_title:0 "Stop the Taoistic Heresy"
 HKR_stop_the_taoistic_heresy_desc:0 "In Gensokyo there's not only the Buddhistic heresy. In recent times a stranger from the ancient land Japan arrived in Gensokyo and converted the local population - only through her charismatic speakings - to the strange religion of Taoism. This 'prince' is a threat for the way of the gods and should be reminded that we are the religious head of Gensokyo."
 HKR_convert_gensokyo_title:0 "Convert Gensokyo"
 HKR_convert_gensokyo_desc:0 "The biggest religious threats are now gone. The only task left is to clean the left heresy in the rest of Gensokyo up. After that we can truely call our realm a religious empire."

 HKR_subjugate_sanae_desc:0 "Sanae, the shrine maiden of the Moriya Shrine, is a lovely person and a worthy rival. Her realm, however, is still a reason for the people of Gensokyo to question our religious authority. We should end this immediately and integrate Sanae's realm and skills in our theocracy."
 HKR_create_an_empire_title:0 "Create the Hakurei Empire"
 HKR_create_an_empire_desc:0 "Gensokyo was for the most part relatively peaceful. But the recent Breaking of the Barrier and the growth of heresy made Gensokyo a place of fighting and wars. If we want to bring peace back we have to create a powerful empire, which can represent an authority for Gensokyo and protect its people from religious and military threats."
 HKR_convert_japan_title:0 "Convert Japan"
 HKR_convert_japan_desc:0 "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbour Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours. Much time has passed since then and the Japanese Shintoism and the Gensokyan Shintoism are now two completely different religions. Yet, if we show them the 'new' form of Shintoism, our Shintoism, they could save themself from their heresy."
 HKR_enlighten_korea_title:0 "Convert Korea"
 HKR_enlighten_korea_desc:0 "With the conversion of the heart of Japan our religious influence in Asia grew immensely. But we are not done yet! The Koreans follow the old way of Confucian, which has many old and useful traditions and mindsets, but it is also outdated. We need to help them so they can follow the way to fortune too!"
 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_title:0 "Challenge the Dragon"
 HKR_challenge_the_dragon_desc:0 "Confucian is an interesting religion: it promotes humanistic ideas and tolerance and it is filled with ancient traditions. But it can also become a danger for any realm, because of these ideas and tradition the state gets slowed down and can't make fast decisions. This problem is currently the cause of the Celestial Empire's fighting. They are slowed in their actions, yet they are still holding on their outdated mindsets. We should challenge them and save them from themselves!"

 HKR_shinto_unites_far_eastern_asia_desc:0 "In the history of Asia, China, Korea and Japan have never had a good relation with each other and wars between these were more common than it should be.

 HKR_expand_the_hakurei_barrier_desc:0 "The old Hakurei Barrier made of magic is lost forever. But this doesn't mean we have failed at our duty as protectors of Gensokyo. Instead we will make a new, naval barrier around Gensokyo and the isles of Micronesia and Taiwan will allow us to build a decent defense line."
 HKR_monopolize_trade_to_gensokyo_title:0 "Monopolize The Trade Flows to Gensokyo"
 HKR_monopolize_trade_to_gensokyo_desc:0 "The Breaking of the old Barrier isn't that bad: it allows now for interesting and profitable trading with the outer world. Yet, the foreign nations are still not trustworthy. If we monopolize every trade node which flows into Gensokyo we can better prepare for their possible plans of conquest. Ohh... and the profit we will make is nice too. Very nice."

 HKR_gensokyos_investigator_desc:0 "Gensokyo was a relatively peaceful land. But these times are over and now youkai, humans, gods and what not are planning to gain more power or to push their agendas in Gensokyo. It is to Reimu to solve these incidents - and earn some additional money this way."

 HKR_witch_trial_title:0 "Witch Trial"
 HKR_witch_trial_desc:0 "While their friendship is unquestionable, Marisa and Reimu still have their own realms to manage. Additionally, Marisa is eager to show Gensokyo her superiority in power over Reimu and while this is a commendable ambition, it is troublesome when we need the Forest's help. Reimu needs to show her that her skills are still unmatched!"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_title:0 "Restore Hakurei Prestige"
 HKR_build_shrine_prestige_desc:0 "With the break of the Hakurei Barrier as well as appearances of heretic religions, the Hakurei shrine maiden's authority has been questioned. Many people see Reimu as a lazy girl, who doesn't care for humanity's safety. Additionally, religious new-comer like Sanae, Byakuren and Miko are earning all the donations, which should be in Hakurei possession. To end this vicious cycle, we must show our capability and reliability-- at least on the surface at the first step."
 HKR_religious_rivals_title:0 "Religious Rivalry"
 HKR_religious_rivals_desc:0 "On the other side of the Youkai Mountain lives Sanae Kochiya, a outlandish and powerful colleague of Reimu. However, Sanae is a heretic and while their relationship isn't that bad, Sanae causes the lack of donors as her shrine gets all the people! She also showed great ambition to spread her religion to all of Gensokyo and challenged our status! We can't indulge in her any longer!"
 HKR_defeat_the_rival_title:0 "End the Rivalry"
 HKR_defeat_the_rival_desc:0 "It is time to finally end the rivalry between Moriya and Hakurei! If we ever want to get our authority back in Gensokyo we have to take over the Moriya lands and convert it to the true Shinto ways!"
 HKR_influence_human_capital_title:0 "Influence the Capital"
 HKR_influence_human_capital_desc:0 "Human capital is the biggest city with the largest human population, and the biggest trade center in Gensokyo. Who can control it controls the heart of Gensokyo. Although people there mostly follow our faith, they seldom go to our shrine and donate to us. We must show them the necessity of going to the shrine and open a direct smooth passage from human capital to our shrine."
 HKR_influence_human_capital_tt:0 "The reward is depending on how our relationship is with the owner of Human Capital. If we go the diplomatic way our reward will be more appealing for diplomacy while conquest / subjugation rewards us with military power.\n\nEvery non-[Root.Religion.GetName] province in §YHuman Capital§! or §YFarmlands§! owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country will be converted to §Y[Root.Religion.GetName]§!."
 HKR_regulate_myouren_temple_title:0 "Regulate Myouren Temple"
 HKR_regulate_myouren_temple_desc:0 "A group of Buddhists, led by Byakuren Hijiri, has landed in the near countryside of the Human Capital. Although they didn't show great desire to spread their faith, they still sought out after control of the capital. We should show them that they can't challenge the status of Hakurei Shinto as the main religion of Gensokyo."
 HKR_warn_the_celestial_title:0 "Eliminate Tenshi!"
 HKR_warn_the_celestial_desc:0 "Tenshi Hinanawi is leading the celestial realm with Taoism faith just like Miko did with Senkai. Although she is far from mainland Gensokyo, Tenshi has the tendency to cause a lot of serious troubles in Gensokyo - and she is quite willing to do so. We should make an example of her and reduce the threat she poses over Gensokyo!"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_title:0 "Back to the Past"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_desc:0 "Originally the Hakurei clan as well as Reimu Hakurei used to live in the northern part of Gensokyo. However, times have changed and the Clan moved to the more fertile and strategically important south so the resources were assured for a reformation of the Hakurei Shinto with the Danmaku system. But some people from the north didn't like this decision and remained \"Hakurei Traditional\" - lead by Meira, an old challenger of Reimu. Meira claimed to become the next, better Hakurei miko. We should teach her that a Hakurei miko's authority is not easily claimed!"
 HKR_back_to_the_past_tt:0 "Every province owned by [Root.GetName] or its subjects in §YEastern§! and §YWestern Old Hakurei Shrine§! will §Glose§! all separatism and autonomy and gain the §YCall to Arms for Reimu§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, which gives the following effects:\nLocal Manpower: §G25%§!\n"
 HKR_devil_from_the_past_title:0 "Devil from the Past"
 HKR_devil_from_the_past_desc:0 "We are back to the old Hakurei Shrine, a relic of old times. But now that we've returned we have to face the old neighbors too: Shinki, the powerful creator and goddess of Makai, has shown a great desire to increase her own status in Gensokyo. She tried to establish a new religion and to spread that to all Gensokyans. Although she is a goddess, we can't allow such actions. We have to shut her down and make sure no evil creature or mind will ever come out of Makai."
 HKR_devil_from_the_past_no_province:0 "No province outside of §YMakai Coast§!, §YWestern Makai§!, §YMakai§! and §YMakai Peninsula§! follows §YShinkism§!."

 HKR_train_a_miko_army_title:0 "Train the Miko Army"
 HKR_train_a_miko_army_desc:0 "While spellcards are still the norm of duels it won't protect a realm. Every country is building their very own army to compete for a higher status in Gensokyo. As the regulator of Gensokyo in name, we must build our own army now to make this name justified!"
 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_title:0 "Defeat the Scarlet Devil"
 HKR_defeat_the_scarlet_devil_desc:0 "Remilia Scarlet is a weird person - even for Gensokyan standards. While her nature as a vampire suggests only bad things for humans and our realm, her behaviour is in complete contrast to it as she rarely even interact with humans.\nStill, Remilia has the title of the \"Scarlet Devil\" and we heard that she plans on militarizing the fairies working for her. Because of these circumstances we should strike on her first."
 HKR_suppress_youkai_underground_title:0 "Suppress Former Hell"
 HKR_suppress_youkai_underground_desc:0 "The Former Hell, once a place where the evil souls atone for their sins, is now home of the banished, trouble seeking oni, the sinister satoris and other dangerous youkai. While the other residents are not threatening the balance of power in Gensokyo, the oni though might be different: rumors tell that they are gathering power to try to retake the Youkai Mountain - and eventually more from Gensokyo. And the satoris, who are supposed to control them, aren't much trustworthy either. We should take control over these threats ourselves and cleanse heretics on the way."
 hkr_mission_to_not_hakurei_tt:0 "Every province in §YFormer Hell§! that is owned by a [Root.Religion.GetName] country but not itself [Root.Religion.GetName] will gain the §YShrine Maidens on Mission§! modifier for §Y20 years§!, which gives the following effects:\nLocal Missionary Maintenance Cost: §G-25.0%§!\nLocal Missionary Strength: §G+3.0%§!\nLocal Unrest: §G-3§!\n"

 HKR_demons_of_higan_title:0 "The Animalistic Threat"
 HKR_demons_of_higan_desc:0 "Usually they have little to no business for the living in Hell, but shrine maidens reported beast spirits leaving Hell and taking the living in Gensokyo! Of course Reimu reacted quickly and eliminated these spirits as well as challenged those who unleashed them to the mortal world.\nHowever, the rulers - those who let these spirits free - still live on in the Animal Realm of Hell. If we want to make sure that there will never again be a threat from them we have to subjugate their rulers."

 HKR_gather_allies_title:0 "Gather Allies"
 HKR_gather_allies_desc:0 "The times have changed in Gensokyo and every inhabitant of this once so peaceful land knows it. Youkai gather fairies and train them to soldiers, humans start praying to Gods of Wars and heresies are about to be created.\nWhile our shrines have competent defenders, they are no match against an overwhelming force during times of wars. We must ensure the survival of our [Root.GovernmentName] by gathering devout allies."

 HKR_great_power_title:0 "Gensokyo's Great Powers"
 HKR_great_power_desc:0 "It's obvious that some realms have more influence and power in Gensokyo than others. As our goal is to keep Gensokyo safe from outer and inner threats we must make sure that we belong to the great powers of Gensokyo or else any attempt to keep the religious unity and peace in Gensokyo will be doomed to fail."
 HKR_disciplined_shrine_maidens_title:0 "Shrine Maiden Discipline"
 HKR_disciplined_shrine_maidens_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is no [Root.GovernmentName] of war, but sometimes the religious safety of Gensokyo can only be achieved by the sword - like in the case with the Taoists. For this reason many of the young shrine maidens shall now undergo the same training and traditions as Reimu Hakurei, our devout ruling Shrine Maiden, did in the past to make sure that future wars will be easier than the one we had against the former crown prince."

 HKR_eliminate_the_fairies_desc:0 "Sunny Milk, Luna Child and Star Sapphire are the leaders of Sangetsusei - and the cause for many, many costly pranks at the Hakurei Shrine. Reimu's donation box is already running low so having the three fairies causing more troubles than good is not beneficial to our economy. We should take them and the other fairies near them out to make sure that no \"prank\" will be ever played on us again."
 HKR_future_of_shinto_title:0 "Future of Shintoism"
 HKR_future_of_shinto_desc:0 "Hakurei Shintoism is an evolved denomination of the original Japanese Shintoism.

 HKR_reimu_forever_desc:0 "The future of our religion and our realm is secured and the divine Hakurei God is more than pleased with the state of Reimu's accomplishments as both devout shrine maiden and resolute protector of Gensokyo. Now the time has finally come to receive the eternal blessing!"
 HKR_the_gap_hag_threat_title:0 "Lady of the Borders"
 HKR_the_gap_hag_threat_desc:0 "Reimu Hakurei and Yukari Yakumo have a strange relationship: while they both serve Gensokyo by maintaining the Hakurei Barrier, they both have a lot of arguments and teasing. However, unlike Reimu, Yukari has a lot of potential to cause a lot of chaos not only in Gensokyo but also outside and due to her complex mind it's not easy to understand her schemes.\nIt would be beneficial for everyone when she and Reimu reform the Barrier Team again."
 HKR_future_of_hakurei_title:0 "Future of [Root.GetName]"
 HKR_future_of_hakurei_desc:0 "The [Root.GovernmentName] has overcome wars, incidents and the Donation Box Curse. But we shouldn't rest on the achievements of the past and make sure that the future of the Hakurei Realm is ensured!"

 HKR_new_power_distribution_desc:0 "Suika Ibuki is a traveling Oni, who likes to drink and cause brawls.

One day, the shrine maiden, the humans and Suika got in a conflict at the shrine, which ended in a hefty brawl and Suika leaving [Root.GetName].\nWhile she is already gone, it got revealed later that the youkai of our realm planned this conflict to get more influence within the [Root.GovernmentName].

 HKR_genji_the_turtle_desc: "Despite his age and his ... turtle being ... Genjii is a powerful defender of the Shrine and served Reimu as a flying device before she learned to fly on her own. Because of that service, Genjii suffers heavy back pain and is currently basically useless. He needs some healing before he can help us out yet again.\nFortunately, the Aki Sisters in the Shrine of Harvest have some helpful ingredients for the healing. If we get on good terms with its owner we might heal Genjii from his severe back pain."

 HKR_harness_shions_power_desc: "There are many gods in Gensokyo, but none is as costly to house as Shion Yorigami, the goddess of poverty. And because of her powers she causes a lot of bad luck to all the people around her... except for Tenshi. While Reimu often played with the idea of banishing her from the Shrine, Heavenly Realm will not take her either.\nLuckily Reimu had an idea: harnessing the power of Shion in the Shrine's favor. And to test the weaponized poverty out we should unleash her misfortune on one of our rivals."

Ironically though, Reimu thought that Aunn was an intruder and beat her up in a danmaku duel. Because of that misunderstanding she felt quite bad about it and promised to repay to Aunn with a cute gift. However, our realm does not have many possible gifts for such a sweet person like Aunn. Because of that we should focus on expanding our trade influence so we can buy a nice gift for Aunn in the open market of Gensokyo."

 HKR_origins_of_the_hakurei_clan_desc: "For such an important country like ours it is important to be aware of our origins and the history we have made in Gensokyo.

 HKR_touhou_2_title: "March on Reimaden"
 HKR_touhou_2_desc: "While meditating about the past our good Shrine Maiden Reimu remembered that she left the ancient, powerful Yin-Yang Orbs in Reimaden, the home of the vengeful spirit Mima - and she will not give them back easily. It will take some political finesse as well as a big army to show her strength to get Mima returning the Yin-Yang Orbs back to Reimu.\nOr we could just march into Reimaden ourselves and take the orbs from Mima."
 HKR_touhou_3_title: "The Okazaki Reform"
 HKR_touhou_3_desc: "Back in the days when our realm was still in the North, we had contact with people, who claim to be from the future. Their leader is a Professor called Yumemi Okazaki. Despite the issues she has caused for Reimu, the technology and the ideas of stress management helped her significantly.\nBut times have changed and with that the memories of Okazaki's reforms.

 SCR_kappa_technology_title:0 "Claim the Kappa Technology"
 SCR_kappa_technology_desc:0 "It is time to expand the influence of our realm! Gensokyo may be a rich area, yet it is rather small and the world has to show so much more for our nation.

While our $MONARCHTITLE$ respects such love for the homeland it still sounds like a challenge we should take. If we can even beat the mighty dragon than there's nobody who could endanger our new Empire!"

 CRD_two_mansions_one_dynasty_desc:0 "The Misty Lake in the east houses knowledge and weapons of mass destruction. It would be better if the Scarlet Devil Mansion would be under control of a Komeiji - and as a bonus: Koishi will be happy to play with her friend Flandre."

They had once a great home in the Youkai Mountains, but as the tengu arrived the oni got expelled from their own mountain. The needs of our oni subjects aren't that important for us, but the tengu grew to be a serious threat for our security. We should make a preemptive attack against them and secure the loyality of the oni as a bonus."
 CRD_form_the_komeiji_navy_title:0 "Form the Komeiji Navy"
 CRD_form_the_komeiji_navy_desc:0 "A mighty army is great for expanding our realm, but without proper administration the new land won't be ours for long.

 CRD_break_the_barrier_desc:0 "The Hakurei Barrier protects Gensokyo from the Outside. Or rather it should. The Barrier had begun to crack and allows our new navy to pass through it. We should exploit this circumstance, break the barrier once and for all and look for new helping hands."

Yet we should still tame this dragon and claim their Mandate of Heaven for us, but to make this possible we need an entrance to their empire. The korean peninsula should make an excellent starting point for an invasion."

 MHG_zashiki_espionage_desc:0 "You'll notice that we have diplomats to inform our neighbours what our goals are. But instaed of some boring, ancient men in awkward suits our diplomats are zashiki-warashis. These little, childlike youkai are excellent heralds and spies and because of their appearance nobody can be really mad at them. But I didn't use them for espionage missions for a long time and they may be a little rusty now. We should train there spy skills again... and I already know exactly who would be a good target."

I created Gensokyo and the Hakurei Barrier (ok, of course I wasn't quite alone when it was created, but still) and the Hakurei dynasty swore to protect Gensokyo and the Barrier from all intruders. Well, the plot demands that this barrier is for whatever reason gone now and that the young shrine maiden wishes to repair it.\nReimu has the right idea, but without my help she will never be able to repair the barrier in this game.

One or two incidents would make life more interesting here. Later I noticed this girl has some kind of rivalry with me though and she started to annoy me with her pesky Scarlet Mist.\nAfter the incident is solved we should pay her a little visit, little human."

Oh, and a lot of money, some good reputation, a little bit of prestige and one or two gifts from my outworld friends would be nice too."

One day our clan split into two parts: the majority stayed and improved the influence within the royal family while the other part followed Lady Mokou.

We will show this world that we can form an Empire by our own!"
 FUJ_control_mount_fuji_title:0 "Control Mount Fuji"

 FUJ_control_etna_title:0 "Control Mount Etna"
 FUJ_control_etna_desc:0 "Many Italian myths and legends tell about the volcano Etna. It is speculated that this very mountain is the blacksmith of the Roman god Volcanus. The Scarlet Devil never confirmed of the existance of the old gods in Europe, but the flames and fire of this volcano are a good sign that there's maybe more truth to the myths. Anyway, its volcanic traits are great boon for Mokou's practises."

Her reason: \"You know how boring it is to find this item, so I thought you should visit a nice location while you kill birds like the monster you are\".\nObviously Kaguya is teasing our mistress, but for the sake of peace (and cannon fire) she shall get her 20 thousand cannons in Ayutthaya."

No human can survive here for long because of poisonous miasma. Though after many years of its existence, our people always wondered what lays on the other side of the barrier.

But not just that, it seems even this huge piece of land is only a fraction of the outside world.

During her questioning Meira mentioned a mysterious vanishing of shrine maiden from these lands. No matter how long Meira was searching for Hakurei power, she just couldn't find any clue how to obtain it. It seems we have to go look for the other 3 intruders, they surely may know something. We shall start with a vengeful spirit Mima. Also looking for Reimu's traces in nearby realms would be helpful."

According to her, Reimu moved to a new shrine somewhere far away almost right after her return from Makai. Apart from it, Mima's beloved pupil Marisa didn't have any contact with her former master, pretty much like our Alice. There is only one person left, whose location we can confirm - Yuuka, an ominous flower lady living in a mansion called Mugenkan. Maybe she can clear things up regarding Reimu and Marisa?"

Yuuka was a little surprised to meet our mistress under these circumstances and apparently she denied any accusations of plundering our realm. Still she did make remarks about the people we are interested in. Wonderful shrine maiden of paradise Reimu, ordinary magician Marisa and even our Alice - the seven-colored puppeteer. She seems to know the locations of them all. Both Alice and Marisa live now deep in a Forest of Magic in their own realm, while the new Hakurei Shrine is located somewhere to the south. Though at first we need to travel through the human lands where the local population may be quite unfriendly towards demons, youkai and humans alike.

 MKI_capture_vivit_title:0 "Capture Vivit"
 MKI_capture_vivit_desc:0 "This one is a bit tricky. The only information we have are questionable references in some of Yumemi's papers regarding other parallel worlds. According to them, VIVIT is a combat maid-type robot from future powered by mysterious cactus energy. It may be rather hard to find her in this world, but the papers mentioned she was looking for a Holy Grail.\nAccording to another report from Yumemi, the Holy Grail seems to be located in a ruined city near Jerusalem. It's clear she's around here, but we can't figure out the exact location in the end, so we have no choice but to look for as many areas as possible..."

 MRY_organize_kappa_inventors_desc:0 "Kanako has great plans for Gensokyo and the lifestyle on this land, but for this we need engineers, inventors and builders. Fortunately, our close neighbours, the kappas, are what we need. However, their skills truly shine as a team - which they cannot really organize by themselves.

 MRY_back_to_japan_desc:0 "Japan is the land of our origin. It was these islands where Kanako and Suwako fought with their kingdoms against each other - the home of our Shrine Maiden Sanae Kochiya, a place of our heritage.

 MRY_convert_japan_title:0 "Convert Japan"
 MRY_convert_japan_desc:0 "The history of Gensokyo is relatively young. Originally most of the inhabitants and even our religion are from our neighbour Japan, a country split in many small realms like ours.

 LIL_gems_and_choco_desc:0 "The New World is full with wonders we have never seen in Gensokyo! So many beautiful gems and so much of this new strange plant called \"cocoa\"!

 TFR_the_fairy_wars_desc: "The three glorious fairies, our rulers Sunny Milk, Luna Child and Star Sapphire, once tried to unite the fairies, but Cirno has seen it as a declaration of war and fought against our just rulers.

Reimu was always annoying to deal with and her shrine looks dumb, so Sunny has decided to make a plan which is nuking the shrine! However, building bombs isn't the usual skill a fairy has, so we will need the assistance of those humans or kappas... or rather their plans.\nWith Sunny's special abilities, the fairy spies can steal the plans from Kappapolis or from Rika's Place and we can build our own bomb!"

 LAR_colonizing_power_desc: "Exploring is fine and dandy, but we should go a step further and build our own colonies - and we will do it in moderation. Unlike certain spring fanatic fairies or want-to-be pirates, our focus will still remain on Gensokyo. Just a few colonies will help us out."

 SFF_had_the_garden_event:0 "The event §YYuuka's Interests§! has triggered."
 SFF_past_and_present_title:0 "Past and Present"
 SFF_past_and_present_desc:0 "The Background of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of [Root.GetName] is quite unique - even for Gensokyan circumstances. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] witnessed the birth of the Spell Card Rule System and the reforms of Hakura Shintoism and – unlike certain other prominent members of the North – moved with the flow of time. Due to this background, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] followers are divided into the old generation that follows the existing Old Hakurei Shinto and the new generation that follows the Shinto that was reformed by Reimu. But as their conflict grows, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] feels the need to unite them."

 SFF_fence_of_the_garden_title:0 "Fence of the Garden"
 SFF_fence_of_the_garden_desc:0 "Internal conflicts have been consolidated, but we must also prepare for growing external threats. The land of the [Root.GovernmentName] is a very beautiful garden, but it needs a fence to protect the garden to stop the invaders."
 SFF_prepare_war_title:0 "Prepare War"
 SFF_prepare_war_desc:0 "The conflicts in Gensokyo are turning into entire wars with large armies instead of the previous danmaku battles. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] herself has formidable powers, but she can't go to war alone. For the defense of the [Root.GovernmentName] and for preemptive strikes against the enemy, we need brave soldiers and generals to follow her."
 SFF_conquer_dream_sisters_title:0 "The Dream Sisters"
 SFF_conquer_dream_sisters_desc:0 "To the north of our [Root.GovernmentName] is the Dream World where the devil sisters with angel wings live. Originally this area was the land of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and these sisters were friends to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but while [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was away, this sister occupied the Dream World and declared it their own land. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] now wants to reclaim this area and get these mischievous sisters back into our realm."
 SFF_conquer_dream_sisters_tt:0 "The rewards of the mission will vary depending on whether the Dream World is fully annexed or subjugated."
 SFF_suppress_neighborhood_title:0 "Suppress Neighborhood"
 SFF_suppress_neighborhood_desc:0 "There are many powerful forces in Gensokyo, but there are also relatively small ones. In the south of our [Root.GovernmentName] there are two realms: one is led by a young Tsukumogami while the other is a union of fragile youkai. They are too weak to protect themselves! We need to put them in our sphere of influence, protect them from the threat of other forces and strengthen our power while we are at it."
 SFF_rivalry_of_the_past_title:0 "Rivalry of the Past"
 SFF_rivalry_of_the_past_desc:0 "The evil spirit, Mima was once a powerful witch with equal powers to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], but she had long disappeared. However, she decided to reappear recently and declared an own \"empire\". She revealed her ambition to conquer Gensokyo by leading a powerful undead army. It is clear that this vengeful spirit has lost her mind. We should put her back to rest."
 SFF_the_flower_tank_title:0 "Flower tank?"
 SFF_the_flower_tank_desc:0 "Besides Mima, others from the past have decided to make their long-lost existence noticeable again – one of them is Rika. She's just an ordinary human being, but her skills in engineering and building machines, especially the 'self-moving wheeled danmaku battery', are more than that of the kappas. What attracts [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s attention, among others, is the danmaku battery she named the Flower Tank. Considering the name, is there something to do with the magic of flowers?"
 SFF_path_toward_makai_title:0 "Path towards Makai"
 SFF_path_toward_makai_desc:0 "Like other great persons of the past, another one emerged from the dust of history: the Goddess Shinki. There has been reports that the demons of Makai have begun to cause chaos again. To ensure they are no threat to nature, our good [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ordered the invasion of Makai to punish them again. But in order to send troops to Makai, we must first pass the old Hakurei Shrine. Unexpectedly, a samurai was training at the shrine and she asserts no one would be able to pass as long Reimu remains undefeated. Although a honorable fighter, she is in the eyes of [Root.Monarch.GetName] nothing more than a weakling compared to Reimu. We need to drive out this presumptuous Samurai and secure the passage to Makai."
 SFF_showdown_with_goddess_title:0 "Showdown with Shinki"
 SFF_showdown_with_goddess_desc:0 "Finally [Root.Monarch.GetName] reopened the Gate of Makai. Like so many years ago, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has returned to Makai – and the Makaian remember it too well. Compared to Reimu, Marisa and Mima, who once stepped their foot on Makain land, [Root.GetName] is causing fear! And  again, the Goddess Shinki is holding out to stop her – despite her previous defeat. Sometimes history repeats itself..."
 SFF_conflict_with_humans_title:0 "Conflict with Humans"
 SFF_conflict_with_humans_desc:0 "Humans don't know the grace of nature. They indiscriminately claim land, pollute water, cut down forests and hunt down animals. As our [Root.GovernmentName]'s borders their capital now, conflicts with them are growing even bigger. In particular, they are sweeping wealth from all over Gensokyo and use it to develop their city on nature’s cost. We will make them pay for destroying nature and make their wealth ours."
 SFF_ultimate_magic_title:0 "Ultimate Magic"
 SFF_ultimate_magic_desc:0 "Of the south of Human Capital is the legendary Forest of Magic. It once used to be a place for fairies, but after the events in Makai years ago, Marisa and Alice moved into this forest and made it to their home. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] remembers Marisa breaking into her mansion and making a mess and Alice standing up to her with what she calls 'Ultimate Magic'. After defeating Alice, [Root.Monarch.GetName] tried to find out about the Ultimate Magic, but it didn't pay off. It's been a while since then, and according to reports Marisa and Alice have copied  [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s spell and act as if it's their own magic. It seems like they need to be reminded who is the master and who is the novice witch."
 SFF_a_mansion_of_the_lake_title:0 "The most powerful Youkai"
 SFF_a_mansion_of_the_lake_desc:0 "Rumors of a very strong youkai have reached the ears of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Like our [Root.Monarch.GetTitile] of the past, this youkai is said to be a sleepyhead, wearing a parasol like [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] too and pretends to be the most powerful and wisest of youkai kind. Worse of all, she even acts like she is on top of the other youkai. It is said that there is something suspicious about her behavior that is different from other youkai. There seems to be some reason for her to act so arrogant and suspicious. We should meet with that strange youkai and see how much truth is to her superiority – with a good danmaku duel but of course..."
 SFF_judge_the_judge_title:0 "Flower of Higan"
 SFF_judge_the_judge_desc:0 "In Higan, the far opposite side of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Garden in Gensokyo, there grows special flowers called 'Higanbana'. [Root.Monarch.GetName] wants to research the power of death which is kept within these flowers. But their owner, Shiki Eiki-Yamaxanadu, has preached to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and as a result they have clashed in the past, so relationship between these two is at its low. Of course, [Root.Monarch.GetName] could face Eiki in a danmaku duel, but in raw power both are at the same level. Instead, we will need to go the diplomatic path to get one of these flowers."

 SFF_the_land_where_sunrise_title:0 "The Art of Ikebana"
 SFF_the_land_where_sunrise_desc:0 "The humans of Gensokyo have the intriguing hobby of arranging their flowers and plants in special ways so that a room has more \"life\" due to these flower arrangement. However, it is clear that the humans here are outdated in their ways of flower handling - they don't care for aesthetically pleasing patterns.\nFortunately, this art is still alive and developing in the Gensokyan's ancient home: Japan. According to rumors, the shogun Yoshimasa Ashikaga is a patreon of arts and recognizes the deeper meaning of flowers in the high form he calls \"Ikebana\" - Makinger flowers alive. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is highly interested in meeting this man of culture and learn his wisdom from him."

 SFF_bamboo_forest_of_the_lost_title:0 "Bamboo Forest of Lost"
 SFF_bamboo_forest_of_the_lost_desc:0 "To the south of the sunflower fields there is the Bamboo Forest of Lost – a forest which SHOULD be silent like any good forest should be. But it's not the case because Kaguya, the mistress of the Bamboo Forest, and her rival Mokou fight every day. The problem is that when they fight, there are fires everywhere, so they are not only loud but also a fire hazard to the precious garden. If they can't stop fighting, we have to come forward and force them.\n\nHowever, there is one good thing about the Bamboo Forest: the lunarian sage created a garden filled with ingredients for her medicines. The flowers there would make a fine addition to [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s flower collection!"
 SFF_empire_of_the_sunflower_title:0 "Empire of the Sunflower"
 SFF_empire_of_the_sunflower_desc:0 "Sunflowers are flowers that bloom straight to the sun, and they symbolize their strong standing under the power of nature. The same goes for our [Root.GovernmentName]. We have an obligation to embrace the forces of nature and the sun to build a powerful strength in Gensokyo and to spread this power around the world. We will expand our influence to gain the power of plants and nature around the world and to become a more complete empire."
 SFF_continent_of_the_nature_title:0 "Power of the Sun"
 SFF_continent_of_the_nature_desc:0 "The native people of this High Mountains have developed religious rituals to worship the sun. Our shrine maidens and witches have discovered that combining these rituals with our knowledge can actually amplify the power we receive from the sun for our flowers. However, in order to get that power to a meaningful level, the range of consciousness should be increased more broadly. So it seems that we need to expand our influence in this mountainous area."
 SFF_empire_of_the_sun_title:0 "Empire of the Mother Nature"
 SFF_empire_of_the_sun_desc:0 "We preserved and studied the various plants in the Gensokyo and outside world, and we built the gardens of the world that no one had ever seen. Also, the power of Mother Nature from this plants and gardens has made us the most powerful nation in the world, both militarily and economically. This is the power of Mother Nature, and we are the true empires of Mother Nature who deserve to deal with this power!"
 SFF_land_beyond_the_ocean_title:0 "Land Beyond the Ocean"
 SFF_land_beyond_the_ocean_desc:0 "We got a special document during the war in Bamboo Forest. The document is a diary of Houraisan Kaguya, an exiled lunarian and the ruler of Bamboo Forest, written wandering around the world with the wise of the moon who was assisting her before she came to Gensokyo. Particularly interesting to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is the story of the continent, which lies beyond the vast ocean east of Gensokyo. This continent is much wider than Gensokyo, and it retains the image of nature. In accordance with the will of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have decided to establish an intermediate stop on a large island in the ocean, and to send adventurous explorers and colonists to the continent for investigation."

 SFF_sunflower_invasion_title:0 "Sunflower Invasion"
 SFF_sunflower_invasion_desc:0 "We have witnessed the misery of those Europeans committed on their continent. They have no respect for nature and are destroying and making it sick for their own desires! We have to make those arrogant Europeans pay for destroying nature. Now the continent of Europe will shudder before the true power of the New World and Gensokyo!"
 SFF_quantity_and_quality_title:0 "Quantity and Quality"
 SFF_quantity_and_quality_desc:0 "The quantity and quality of armies sometimes seem to be inversely proportional to each other. If it's large, it's bad. If it's good, it's small. But it's a wrong stereotype. Our neighbors will be more afraid of our power if we show them that there can be a large army of the best quality."
 SFF_gardener_corps_title:0 "Gardener Corps"
 SFF_gardener_corps_desc:0 "A strong army needs a general to lead it. In particular, the officers of our [Root.GovernmentName] are taught by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to show very good ability in handling soldiers. They are especially called nickname 'Gardener' by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We need to treat respectfully them to secure their loyalty."

 SFF_establish_military_educational_institution_desc:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has an excellent ability to cultivate a great general, but we cannot rely on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] personal abilities forever.

 SFF_necessity_of_the_navy_title:0 "Necessity of the Navy"
 SFF_necessity_of_the_navy_desc:0 "In the days of Hakurei Barrier, the sea was not an important subject in Gensokyo. However, as the Barrier has fallen, many realms recognized the importance of the sea and began to move beyond it. We are confident to be Gensokyo's strongest ground force, but we should not neglect the importance of the navy."
 SFF_a_vast_ocean_title:0 "A Vast Ocean"
 SFF_a_vast_ocean_desc:0 "The ocean beyond the barrier seems much wider and infinite than we thought. Other countries in Gensokyo are already expanding their presence beyond the sea. But the open sea before our eyes is so wide that we don't even know if there's land beyond it. Can we really find a new land beyond the ocean?"
 SFF_training_ocean_navy_title:0 "Training Ocean Navy"
 SFF_training_ocean_navy_desc:0 "Since explorations to the beyond of the great border have started, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s interest has been directed at the flowers and plants of the outside world. But to secure them safely, we'll need an ocean navy that can operate in the distant seas."
 SFF_native_of_the_high_mountain_title:0 "Natives of the High Mountain"
 SFF_native_of_the_high_mountain_desc:0 "Our explorers found the towering mountains of the New Continent coast and natives living there. These natives, though not as much as Tengu of Gensokyo, adapt themselves to the high mountains and are fighting in different forces. It seems that we need to approach them more closely to get to know them better."

 SFF_belly_button_of_the_world_desc:0 "Notable people in this mountainous region are the natives who think they live in the 'belly button of the world' themselves. They have long served the sun as a god, and some of their priests consider us the lions of the sun. But some others have expressed hostility toward us. Their fate is now in our hands."
 SFF_invader_from_the_west_title:0 "Invader From the East"
 SFF_invader_from_the_west_desc:0 "We have successfully established ourselves in the New Continent, but there appeared those who are jealous of our success. Claiming themselves to be from a distant continent, they are showing a greedy interest in things that would be money for them, especially gold, rather than in the beautiful nature of the New Continent. We will have to drive out these unpleasant invaders and maintain the order we set."

 SFF_forest_of_the_outside_1_desc:0 "Beyond the mountains we conquered, there is a huge rain forest. According to the colonists and natives, this rain forest is stretched out so wide that even the natives cannot enter the deepest part of the forest. In other words, it would mean that this vast forest is overflowing with the power of intact nature that is untouched by humans. If we can send our shrine maidens to the entrance of the forest, be able to experience and bring the power of life there."

In particular, indigenous people living on the coast of this rain forest believe that the gods they serve live in the forest and hold the forest sacred. As it was in the New World, it seems necessary to send our shrine maidens to study the strength and faith of life in this rain forest. However, we will have to send a small group of maidens as the distance is way too large for maintaining more shrine maidens oversea. Fortunately, more are not needed as a small colony will already be able to achieve sufficient results by seeking the consent of the natives."

Most people in Europe believe monotheistic religion, but in the past, there was a religion in northern Europe that believed in many gods, especially those related to forests, similar to Gensokyo. There are few traces of this religion now, but there are still thick forests in the area they considered a holy place, and if we send shrine maidens, will be able to study the power left in this forest. However, European countries may not be pleased with this kind of visit, so more complicated procedures may be needed..."

Although there are many voices of concern in [Root.GovernmentName] about the 'Manufactories' that arise with the advance of technology, the power of nature we have are powerful enough to heal the pollution caused by it. And if the products of this technology used well, this could make our nature more fertile and be useful for the country and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s garden."
