 ###MRS EVENTS###
 flavor_mrs.1.t: "Maintenance of Moon Rabbit transport ships"
 flavor_mrs.1.desc: "It has been many years since our last routine check up on the transport ships of the 8th Moon Rabbit army. In light of recent events, the army has at last received the long desired funding to do so, but as the Lunarian officers find themselves in possession of such large quantities of funding, they can't help but question if those lowly Moon Rabbits are truly worthy of all these resources. Perhaps they could be put to better use elsewhere?"
 flavor_mrs.1.a: "Orders are orders, upgrade the ships!"
 flavor_mrs.1.b: "Sell everything that can't be seen from the outside. The Rabbits will have to make due"
 flavor_mrs.2.t: "Rough Landing"
 flavor_mrs.2.desc: "A few hours have passed since we plummeted from the sky as a burning ball of flames after discovering that the ship's fire extinguishers had been replaced with simple water bottles. \nDespite the rough landing, most of us were able to safely escape the burning wreckage once it hit the ground. However, we're still unsure if that was for the better as we've found ourselves stranded in an unknown world without food, supplies, or any way to communicate with the moon. \nEven better, we seem to be surrounded by a strange human people that show themselves very intrigued by the great pillar of fire that our ship has turned into, for now it's likely for the best if we hide our true identity from them as we take advantage of their interest."
 flavor_mrs.2.a: "We'll have to make due"
 flavor_mrs.2.a.tt: "Wait, is anyone actually making sure the fire doesn't spread? Oh no...."
 flavor_mrs.3.t: "First Contact"
 flavor_mrs.3.desc: "It appears that the strange humans have gathered around us under the impression that we were attempting to have a great pow-wow with all the tribes around us...the sight of hundreds of panicking Moonrabbits aimlessly running around the fire quickly dispelled that impression. Thankfully for us, our surprise guests, instead of leaving, quickly got to work, helping us. Displaying an impressive mastery of the flames, they had tamed the fire within no more than an hour and even put the flames to use, clearing the land around the wreckage, laying the groundwork for any future settlement of ours. \n\nOnce their work was done they began to celebrate while we Moonrabbits looked on in curiousity. Finally, one of us stepped forward, taking the hands of two humans she began to dance with them as if it was the most normal thing on the moon. Seeing that, the rest of us quickly joined in and for the first time in memory, we celebrated, danced and laughed the night away, free of worry and fear. \nBy dawn, the humans finally left. The night had given us not only friends but also hope."
 flavor_mrs.3.a: "Maybe this weird land isn't so bad after all"
 flavor_mrs.4.t: "Revealing the Truth"
 flavor_mrs.4.desc: "Our allies have accepted us with such great kindness that we can't bear to hide our true identity from them any longer. And so, after summoning all allied tribes, a wellspoken Rabbit steps forward and reveals the truth to them, telling them that we are Moonrabbits that have fallen from the sky. After the explanation has ended, the humans stare at us for a moment as we collectively fear their reaction. A few seconds later they burst into laughther, leaving us utterly confused.\n\nAs it turned out, they were very much aware of all that already. They tell us that it was quite hard to miss our spaceship falling from the sky, not to mention that humans with bunny ears are also a rather rare sight. The Moonrabbit that had assured us all of the perfection of our disguises just a few days ago silently sneaks away with a red face.\nThe humans go on to tell us that even before our arrival, they knew about our kind, for their ancestors had long told stories of rabbits on the moon. Our worries were unfounded as our allies celebrate the night away with us once more.\nOur little crashsite has since become the capital of our new federation."
 flavor_mrs.4.a: "Honesty truly is a virtue"
 flavor_mrs.4.a.tt: "§JWar can't always be avoided. However, it would be wise for us to bury the hatchet whenever possible. Waging war might bring temporary gain, but walking the path of the great Peacemaker will forge unity and allow us to prosper far greater than we could ever imagine. Focus on building a Federation rather than conquest!"§!
 flavor_mrs.5.t: "A Rabbit named Reisen"
 flavor_mrs.5.desc: "The humans here speak of the importance of names, claiming that they provide insight into a person's nature and personality...that they hold power far greater than we might imagine.\n\nReisen is likely the most famous name among us Moonrabbits, tradionally being given to the pet Rabbits of the Watatsuki sisters. For the longest time, this name only awoke scorn and jealousy in fellow Moonrabbits, but that all changed when the last Reisen vanished overnight. For the longest time we believed her to have perished, replaced the next day with yet another Reisen...but then she returned to the moon. The sight of her inspired every Moonrabbit for she achieved something that our race had almost forgotten by that time...she chose her own path and found a purpose to fight for.\n\nIn these trying times, the memory of her still remains close to our hearts as we too search for a purpose while we gradually develop a sense of duty making our own choices for the first time in our lives. One Rabbit in particular has stuck out during all of this, guiding, advicing, and inspiring all of us, many have begun to call her by the name of Reisen.\n\nMay she lead us like her namesake would, with courage and..."

 flavor_mrs.5.d: "Freedom"
 flavor_mrs.5.d.tt: "Reisen will receive a random personality"
 flavor_mrs.6.t: "A Rabbit named Ringo"
 flavor_mrs.6.desc: "The humans here speak of the importance of names, claiming that they provide insight into a person's nature and personality...that they hold power far greater than we might imagine.\n\n The name Ringo, belonging to a high ranking and capable, yet otherwise unremarkable Moonrabbit information officer, was frequently whispered among our ranks for ages. Not much was known about her due to her desire to be alone as much as possible. But if a Moonrabbit was in trouble, desperate and in need of help, they often turned to Ringo, for unlike her many colleagues, she frequently showed kindness and a genuine desire to help the weak. In recent times the whispers have turned louder and louder after rumours of her desertion to the earth began to spread and were quickly confirmed. Rabbits soon told tales of her founding a great business, prospering while aiding all the other Moonrabbits hiding there. Many of us have dreamed about joining her down there.\n\nIt comes as little surprise then that when a cunning and kind merchant emerged from our ranks, showing incredible skill during trading negotations with the humans while aiding all around her, that many of us quickly took to calling her Ringo.\n\nMay she lead us like her namesake would, with cunning and..."

 flavor_mrs.6.c: "Skill"
 flavor_mrs.6.c.tt: "Ringo will receive the midas touched personality"
 flavor_mrs.7.t: "Guns and Cannons"
 flavor_mrs.7.desc: "We've already salvaged much from the wreckage, taking both supplies and everything that might prove useful, now it is time for the armaments. While most of them were destroyed during the crash, by cannibalizing the broken ones for parts, we can gather just enough to assemble a powerful and great cannon. Some Moonrabbits however recommend that we instead use the parts to build a series of small firearms instead." 
 flavor_mrs.7.a: "We shall build the greatest of cannons!"
 flavor_mrs.7.b: "It's likely wise to spread our resources out"
 flavor_mrs.8.t: "A Rabbit named Rei'sen"
 flavor_mrs.8.desc: "The humans here speak of the importance of names, claiming that they provide insight into a person's nature and personality...that they hold power far greater than we might imagine.\n\nFor better or worse, the name Rei'sen is known to almost every Moonrabbit. Being the successor to the great traitor, she was met not only with both the scorn and envy of her fellow Moonrabbits but also found herself in the shadow of her fabled predecessor. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Rei'sen has ensured that her name would be remembered forever among our kind. Showing unwavering loyalty to the Watatsukis, iron discipline, and combat prowess matched only by Reisen herself. She has earned herself the begrudging respect and admiration of most Moonrabbits, enjoying particular fame among the frontline soldiers.\n\nFor the longest time we thought that it impossible that an ordinary Moonrabbit could ever come even close to matching her fiercesomeness, but during these times of strife and new beginnings, a Rabbit has emerged from within our ranks that might just be able to. Leading our armies to victory in many great battles, it didn't take long for her sisters in arms to call her by the name of Rei'sen.\n\nMay she lead us like her namesake would, with strength and..."
 flavor_mrs.8.a: "Discipline"

 flavor_mrs.8.c: "Martial Skill"
 flavor_mrs.8.c.tt: "Rei'sen will receive the martial educator personality"
 flavor_mrs.9.t: "A Rabbit named Seiran"
 flavor_mrs.9.desc: "The humans here speak of the importance of names, claiming that they provide insight into a person's nature and personality...that they hold power far greater than we might imagine.\n\nThe name of Seiran is one burnt into the hearts of many Moonrabbits. Belonging to a common Moonrabbit serving as an infiltrator, an incredibly dangerous job with very little pay. She was essentially no more than cannonfodder for the Lunarian military and was very much treated as such. Our hearts heavy with shame, many of us must admit that they too participated in this despicable treatment of her, with Seiran having been the frequent target of bullying, shown respect by neither the Lunarians nor her own Moonrabbit sisters. Like most infiltrators, she was eventually sent out on a mission without reinforcements and under threat of death. Instead of succumbing to her fate however, she came to blows with the legendary traitor herself and deserted soon after. The story told among Moonrabbits says that she then went on to administrate the production of a great business on the earth. Her name has become not only a lesson in comraderie but an inspiration among countless Moonrabbits, allowing even the lowest and weakest among us to dream of reaching heaven.\n\nAs this settlement of ours began to expand ever more rapidly,it didn't take long for the need of an administrative system to arise. Many of us Moonrabbits stepped up to answer the call but one stood out and soon took on the name of Seiran.\n\nMay she lead us like her namesake would, driven and..."

 flavor_mrs.9.c: "Untiring"
 flavor_mrs.9.c.tt: "Seiran will receive the lawgiver personality"
 flavor_mrs.10.t: "A mysterious stranger"
 flavor_mrs.10.desc: "In the early hours of dawn, a mysterious stranger arrived. Cloaked entirely in rags, she claims to be a medicine woman and wishes to help us connect with our fellow countrymen, claiming to be able to communicate with any other tribe through the power of our ancestors. Indeed she seems to speak the truth as we soon found out as she demonstrated it before our very eyes."
 flavor_mrs.10.a: "Let us welcome her then!"
 flavor_mrs.11.t: "The path of the Peacemaker"
 flavor_mrs.11.desc: "Through the combined efforts of us Moonrabbits, holy prophets like the Great Peacemaker, and many legendary chieftains, we have spread our message of peace and unity across the entire continent. Countless have joined us and our numbers grow with every passing day. However, there are still those not yet receptive to our message for they refuse to relinquish the scars of the past. For this reason we have assembled many of our greatest diplomats to finally resolve every remaining issue and conflict between the totemist tribes of this continent so that we may all join together.\n\nBut as we complete the final preparations, voices have begun to arise that speak of the animist tribes to the south of our great continent. The voices claim that it might be more wise to send our diplomats to these tribes instead, so they too get the chance to join our great Federation.\n\nWhat path shall we take?"
 flavor_mrs.11.a: "We shall focus on our closest first"
 flavor_mrs.11.a.tt: "All totemist tribes will see their relations with us dramatically improved"
 flavor_mrs.11.b: "Let us establish communications with the south!"
 flavor_mrs.11.b.tt: "All animist tribes we currently know about will see their relations with us dramatically improved"
 flavor_mrs.12.t: "The Call to Arms"
 flavor_mrs.12.desc: "Even during the most peaceful of times, we shall never forget that our realm was formed not by merchants or diplomats, but by soldiers. Our martial tradition lies at the very core of Moonrabbit society and is the sole thing that connects all of us. Every Moonrabbit that claims to be our leader is therefore expected to take up arms and be present on the battlefield, leading us from the front! Anything else would be unacceptable."
 flavor_mrs.12.a: "We shall follow [Root.Monarch.GetName] until the grave!"
 flavor_mrs.13.t: "The Great Debate"
 flavor_mrs.13.desc: "Though we have done our best to walk the path of peace, we can't expect to remain on it as evil surrounds us from all sides, threatening to drown out our very existence. With the sails of the Lunarians on the horizon in the West and Invaders in shining armor encroaching in the East...our hand is forced. As insane as it might be, to keep our holy peace we must take up arms and strike down the tyrants!"
 flavor_mrs.13.a: "We will not be put into chains again!"
 flavor_mrs.14.t: "Election!"
 flavor_mrs.14.desc.a: "It is once again time for elections in [Root.GetName]. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is eligible to be re-elected into the [Root.GetAdjective] office, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must defeat [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] other primary competitors first.."
 flavor_mrs.14.desc.b: "It is once again time for elections in [Root.GetName]. Fate was not keen on [Root.Monarch.GetName] and so [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had to leave office. Three primary candidates try to get the votes of the rabbits..."

 flavor_mrs.15.t: "Election!"
 flavor_mrs.15.desc: "The unfortunate accident of [Root.Monarch.GetName] surprised the country. Fortunately for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis], it was not a lethal accident.\nStill, this incident caused an emergency election for the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName]..."

 flavor_mrs.16.b: "We shall shatter Imperialism!"
 flavor_mrs.16.c: "All calm at the moment..."
 flavor_mrs.17.t: "Focus of the Revolution"
 flavor_mrs.17.desc: "We have declared a war, a crusade, a revolution against every single tyrant of this world. However, the question remains on who we should focus on first.\n\nShall we march against the countless Feudal lords and shatter their petty fiefs so we may liberate their slaves, serfs and peasants?\n\nOr shall we declare war against the great Empires of this World so we may dismantle their rule of terror and liberate the people they oppress?"
 flavor_mrs.17.a: "We shall shatter the empires of this world!"

Our Revolutionary Focus can be changed at any time in the decision tab at the cost of 1 stability.\n\nWith Feudalism as our Revolutionary Focus, we will receive §IRabbit Revolution Level I§! upon having 20 or more countries in a coalition against us. Scaling in steps of 20 countries, the maximum Revolutionary Level we can reach is V at 100 countries.\nWith Imperialism as our Revolutionary Focus, we will receive one Revolutionary Level for every current Great Power that is in a coalition against us. Once again the limit is Revolutionary Level V at 5 Great Powers.\n\nThe Revolutionary Level is updated after every election. In the decision tab we can call an emergency election every 20 years, which also updates the Revolutionary Level. Care is adviced when making a major peace deal"

 flavor_mrs.19.t: "Religious question"
 flavor_mrs.19.desc: "Ever since the Lunarians took over the Moon, we Moonrabbits have been forced to follow their Lunarian faith. However, this was never truly a choice for most of us and as soon as we crashed here, an infinity away from the nearest Lunarian whip, most of us almost immediately abandoned any notion of following the Lunarian scriptures. Instead, the tales of the local humans quickly caught our interest. Tales of our ancestors, mighty and free, that were given the moon as a gift. Tales of dreams and tales of animal spirits. It is easy to see why most of us eagerly accepted the local way of life and religion with such enthusiasm and why we will never let them go. Still, now that we have chosen this path of Revolution, many believe that it is time to reevaluate our official faith.\n\nThree factions have emerged. The largest of them desires to keep the current status quo, to embrace the tales we've come to hold so dear to our heart and the religious freedom they bring.\n\nThe second faction argues that even if we don't wish for it to be true, Lunarism is undeniably a part of our past. Instead of discarding it we should create a schism in the Lunarian church and eventually shatter the oppressive doctrine of the Lunar Capital.\n\nLastly there is the third faction, by far the tiniest. Made up of a handful of merchants and former infiltrators, they tell stories of a mysterious eastern faith that is able to harmonize with every other religion and bring true religious freedom to everyone."

The gold mines of this land are numerous beyond belief, seemingly endless in both number and depth. Securing this land has not only allowed us to liberate the local people but also to gain access to the resources we need to defend our brave continent from any invaders.\nStill, the question remains how we shall administer these countless gold mines..."

 flavor_mrs.22.desc: "Our realm was created by a former Lunarian Army, it is therefore no surprise that there has always been a bit of a conflict between the different branches. From the very first moment there has been a tug of war between the Moonrabbits favouring a heavy infantry doctrine and those favoring a mobile warfare doctrine. Of course there's also the descendents of the former pilots...who just want to forget about the whole army thing and invest everything we have into the Navy.\n\nIt is time for us to make a choice and take a side!"

Still, though our way of life was taken from us by force, we shall never relinquish the few stories and tales that still remain to us.

Our settlement, originally no more than a handful of borrowed wigwams around a smoldering wreckage, is expanding daily as we establish communications with ever more tribes around us. Not all contact is entirely friendly but we are always treated not as tools or animals like back on the moon, but equals. Still, as our federation grows larger, so does our anxiety. Despite all the kindness we've been shown, we haven't been truthful with the people here and an alliance built on lies can never last. No matter what the consequences might be, we shall reveal the truth to our friends!"
 MRS_Reisen_title: "A Rabbit named Reisen"
 MRS_Reisen_desc: "As our settlement expands further and further, we soon find ourselves with the question of how to rule and administrate this realm of ours. During many talks and debates, one Moonrabbit stands out. Intelligent and courageous, she inspires all around her and naturally begins to lead us. As we look towards her, we are reminded of a certain name."
 MRS_great_longhouse_title: "The great Longhouse"
 MRS_great_longhouse_desc: "As our settlement expands, so does our federation. Growing ever larger and encompassing ever more people, we still wish to stay true to our principles of equality. For that reason we shall build a great Longhouse, the largest in the entire world. Working in tandem with smaller longhouses, this great monument will ensure that all voices are heard." 
 MRS_ancestor_one_title: "Those that came before"
 MRS_ancestor_one_desc: "The humans here speak of the importance of remembering the past and honoring our ancestors. Indeed it would be wise for us to remember the many great heroes that helped us build this nation of ours. We shall invest in the creation of both art and scriptures so we may never forget the lessons they've taught us!"

 MRS_ancestor_two_desc: "The humans here speak of the importance of remembering the past and honoring our ancestors. Indeed it would be wise for us to remember the many great heroes that helped us build this nation of ours. We shall invest in the creation of both art and scriptures so we may never forget the lessons they've taught us!" 
 mrs_ancestor_recommendation: "It would be wise to invest these resources into the construction of totems.\n§RTotem buffs remain active even if we convert.§!"
 MRS_Ringo_title: "A Rabbit named Ringo"
 MRS_Ringo_desc: "Our settlement now reaches as far as the great Sea to the East. We cannot help but marvel at the beauty of it, with many of our citizens already thinking of the countless possibilites this feat of nature might bring us. Among these dreaming Moonrabbits, one of them stands out, a single conversation with her leaving every human impressed and eager to trade with us. Her cunning and kindness remind us of a certain name."
 MRS_filling_the_treasury_title: "Filling the treasury"
 MRS_filling_the_treasury_desc: "Trade brings not only prosperity but also connections. But as more and more people rely on us for their livelihoods, we have to ensure that we won't ever be forced to let them down following a drought or accident. Only if we have the necessary reserves to weather the storm, can we truly make treaties with confidence."
 MRS_equip_a_warparty_title: "Equipping a Warparty"
 MRS_equip_a_warparty_desc: "While our focus might be one of peace, we can't expect every human to go along with this mission of ours. Furthermore, if we truly wish for the humans to place their trust into us, we must be prepared to defend them, should the worst come to pass. We shall therefore raise a warparty, equipped with everything we can still scavenge from the wreck"
 MRS_Rei'sen_title: "A Rabbit named Reisen"
 MRS_Rei'sen_desc: "Our initial warparty was hastily assembled from a few capable volunteers. However, one Moonrabbit among those volunteers has always stood out. Immediately assuming a leadership position, she has transformed our little warband into a proper force that could strike down even the greatest threat. As we watch her lead from the front with iron discipline and incredible bravery, we are reminded of a certain name"
 MRS_unite_the_tribes_title: "Uniting the great tribes"
 MRS_unite_the_tribes_desc: "Our mission of peace and unity is shared by many across the continent. One of our diplomats has recently contacted the Great Peacemaker, the holy prophet that united the Haudenosaunee people. After a long conversation, he agreed to join us, suggesting that we use our telepathic powers to connect all the tribes across this great continent. He assures us that there are many men and women like him and if we are able to connect them all, we might be able to create a treaty of peace so great our imagination can't do it justice."
 mrs_connecting_world: "§JThrough our telepathic powers, we will establish a network of communication across the continent. This will allow us to expand our federation further than ever before§!"
 MRS_path_of_the_peacemaker_title: "The Path of Peace"
 MRS_path_of_the_peacemaker_desc: "Our Federation has grown to encompass much of the continent and our mission of unity seems almost complete. Still, we can't rest until every conflict and grievance has been resolved. Spearheaded by the Great Peacemaker, we shall equip a great diplomatic mission to wander the land and truly resolve every grudge that may still remain."
 MRS_expand_the_settlement_title: "Expanding the Settlement"
 MRS_expand_the_settlement_desc: "As our number swells over the years, so does the need for a greater settlement. Already many Moonrabbits and Humans have settled around the initial wreckage, leading to a natural expansion of our original settlement. It is time to make this expansion official."
 MRS_Seiran_title: "A Rabbit named Seiran"
 MRS_Seiran_desc: "Our realm grows ever larger and with it grows the complexity of its administration. Many Moonrabbits shudder at the mere thought of trying to understand even a fraction of it but a few have risen to the challenge, led by a particularly capable Rabbit. Always among the most shy and weakest of us, she now leads her sisters with nothing but the greatest of confidence and skill. The sight of her reminds of a certain name"
 MRS_Lunaria_title: "Lunaria!"
 MRS_Lunaria_desc: "Our dream has finally come true. During a grand ceremony, representatives of every tribe have come together, all of them agreeing to join under a common banner so every tribe may prosper. Across the continent, fires of joy and celebration are lit and will likely keep burning for many days and nights."
 mrs_unification_tt: "§JWe will be able to consolidate our newly united Federation and explore our surroundings.§!"
 MRS_great_split_title: "The Great Question"
 MRS_great_split_desc: "In Hindsight it might have been foolish to assume that our great peace would last forever. As the sails of the Lunarians fly in the distance, we are forced to return once more to the great Longhouse...this time not for talks of peace."
 MRS_gold_of_Moctezuma_title: "The Gold of Moctezuma"
 MRS_gold_of_Moctezuma_desc: "To our south lies the home of a rotting Empire, shackling its people while hoarding vast amounts of wealth. If we wish to stand a chance against the tyrants of the world, we need to secure both the gold and the freedom of our southern brothers."
 MRS_connecting_worlds_title: "Connecting Worlds"
 MRS_connecting_worlds_desc: "After shattering the Aztec Empire, we soon found ourselves before the realization that this landmass is far greater than we could have ever predicted. An entire second continent lies south of us! However, the invader has already established a significant foothold there. It is vital for us to advance quickly and push them back!"
 MRS_pax_americana_title: "Pax Americana"
 MRS_pax_americana_desc: "It is our duty to drive the invader back into the sea, no matter the cost. Once we have done so, no tyrant of the world will be able to ignore us any longer!"

The trip stretched the crane's legs as the heavy rabbit held them tightly, leaving them elongated as the legs of all cranes are now. When they reached the Moon, the rabbit touched the crane's head with a bleeding paw, leaving the red mark cranes wear to this day. According to the legend, on clear nights, Rabbit still may be seen riding the Moon."
