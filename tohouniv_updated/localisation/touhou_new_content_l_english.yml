flavor_hvr.19.t: "Dualism of Slavic Gods"
flavor_hvr.19.desc: "In old Slavic culture, the gods and spirits were polarized, representing opposites, such as darkness and light, masculine and feminine.\n\nFor Slavic people, the highest god of the pantheon was Perun, the god of sky, thunder, lightning, storms, rain, law, war, fertility and oak trees. With Iku abilities to control thunder, lightning, storm and rain, it will be quite easy to represent her as the descendant of the Perun, gaining the trust of the Slavic people, and converting them to the old faith!\n\nMat Zemlya, meaning Mother Earth, was being the oldest deity in old Slavic religion, and one of the most important one too. The earth, according to the common Slavic tradition, is a symbol of motherhood and femininity. She is the universal Mother and nurse: she nourishes the living, and accepts the dead. With Tenshi ability to control and manipulate Earth, she is more than ready to prove herself to be a Mother Earth for the Slavic people, returning their faith to the old ways. Even before becoming a celestial, Tenshi first name was Chiko, which means Earth Child. Who knows, perhaps Tenshi was always connected to Mother Earth, being her descendant.\n\nIn riddles and old sayings, archaic ideas about sky (Perun) and earth (Mother Earth) as a married couple have been preserved. With both Iku representing Perun, and Tenshi representing Mother Earth, we will surely gain trust of Slavic people!"
flavor_hvr.19.a: "Welcome to True Faith!"
flavor_hvr.20.t: "Judgement Day"
flavor_hvr.20.desc: "With the fall of Rome, and arrival of that mysterious girl that claim herself to be a Celestial Angel and Goddess at the same time, Christians really started to doubt their own faith. The rumors says, that the Judgement day is here, and the only way to find the salvation - is to accept Tenshi as our saviour.\n\nAnd we can certainly use that against them! Let them think that the Judgement day is upon them, and that only Tenshi can save them! So, abandom your old faith, and accept Tenshi as your sole Saviour in the apocalypce ahead! And for those that still doubt Tenshi... there is a few meteorites that can accidently fall into your country!"
flavor_hvr.20.a: "Let the Judgement Day begin!"
flavor_hvr.21.t: "Miko Blessing"
flavor_hvr.21.desc: "We helped Miko in a rather important matter by humiliating her main religious rival, Byakuren. Now, Byakuren herself has been forced to accept Taoism as her main religion!\n\nFor these deeds, Miko is very grateful to us, and Tenshi in particular. As such, Miko blesses Tenshi to rule the Heavenly Realms, which will increase Tenshi's authority among the religious class of our country."
flavor_hvr.21.a: "Good."
flavor_hvr.22.t: "A Nice Beating for Yukari"
flavor_hvr.22.desc: "There has always been a rather strained relationship between Tenshi and Yukari. Well, from now on, these differences have been resolved! Tenshi gave Yukari a good beating that Yukari would not forget for a long time. Perhaps Yukari will have to rest... for 20 or 30 years.\n\nNot only that, Tenshi, and our country in particular, has received a lot of prestige for beating up one of the strongest beings of Gensokyo, sage Yukari Yakumo herself. Perhaps, other countries will even turn a blind eye if we conquer their neighbors."
flavor_hvr.22.a: "We showed this Old Hag her place!"
flavor_hvr.23.t: "Old Norse"
flavor_hvr.23.desc: "According to the ancient belief of the peoples of Scandinavia, people are filled with a divine essence that is outside of consciousness. This divine essence is expressed through gods and goddesses. The gods are relatives of people, it is customary to honor and praise the gods. The most notable god in the old Norse religion was the supreme god of the pantheon, who is revered the most, Odin. Thor, son of Odin, is the lord of storms and the guardian of the world of people, was also very famous and respected. Other gods such as Freyja, Loki, Yggdrasil, Tyr, Njord were also fairly known and respected.\n\nThe interesting fact about the Norse gods, is that they were eating miraculous rejuvenating apples, that allowed them to remain immortal and gave them strength. It almost sounds like our Heavenly Peaches - a special kind of peaches growing in heaven, which allows anyone eating them, to increase their strenght.\n\nWith excellent ability to control storms, hurricanes, and lightning, Iku can pass herself off as Odin's daughter quite easily. With abilities quite similar to Thor, son of Odin, she will claim herself to a daughter of Odin, which will help in submitting Scandivian people to us, and our faith.\n\nWith a great ability to destroy everything in her path, with her warlike spirit and hot temper, Tenshi can easily impersonate Brunhilde, the great Valkyrie, to lead the Scandinavian people into a war against our enemies!"

flavor_hvr.24.desc: "We have discovered a free, unused land on the continent, which is called America. The lands of America are vast, and it is inhabited only by backward tribes. By seizing these lands for ourselves, we will be able to increase our influence in the world, and in Gensokyo in particular.\n\nThe region, called Cascadia is nothing of interest. The climate here is harsh, but controlling these lands will allow us to create a transit point with Gensokyo, allowing us to more comfortably travel between Heavens, Gensokyo, and America.\n\nNow, in order to create settlements in Cascadia, we will need people and money. The more we invest in our expedition, the faster we will create a colony."

It is warm here, the sun shines on these lands quite often, and the ocean breeze adds coolness, making the weather most pleasant. Around us - the ocean, mountains, fields. This place definitely has an eye-catching beauty.\n\nBut that's not all. The Aboriginal tribes that inhabited the area of California told us about the rumors that California is rich in minerals, such as gold, silver, and iron. Let's test this rumor by examining the mountains and mines of California. Perhaps we can find something."

That doesn't seems to be a proper way if we want to establish complete domination over America. So, we should create a whole new country instead!\n\nFrom now on, Heavenly States of America will be created! This new country will be under our direct control, and will unite all of the scattered small colonies into one, strong country!

They will provide us with best troops and ships that they can offer, concentrating only on army, ignoring the trade completely.\n\nOr, we can make Heavenly States completely concentrate on trade instead. This will allow us to transfer trade power from them, and receive large economical benefits."

This decision will provide you with dynamic reward, providing you with merchants and global trade power.

It takes time, supplies, and our traders don't even want to make such a long trip on the lands without proper roads.\n\nWe shall fix this immidiently, by starting a grand construction throught the whole America! We will build  a modern road that will connect most of our American states. This road will allow our troops to travel through whole America without issues, filled to the brim with supplies. Our traders will also enjoy a modern, protected road.\n\nFor some reason, Tenshi wants to call this grand road as... Route 66."
