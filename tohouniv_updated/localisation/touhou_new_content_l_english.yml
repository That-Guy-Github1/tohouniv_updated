 KPP_great_kappa_exploration_title: "Great Kappa Exploration"
 KPP_great_kappa_exploration_desc: "The world is a sphere and we are its masters. Brave kappa explorers traveled all around the globe and established bases for the great kappa empire."
 KPP_docks_of_the_kappas_title: "Centers of Conscription"
 KPP_docks_of_the_kappas_desc: "We kappa are not warmongers. However, it is apparent that our neighbors do not share this sentiment and prepared their military forces.\nWhile our current administration and government policies are good enough to recruit an emergency army for defense, it is far from sufficient to raise a counter offensive. We must construction additional centers of conscription to change this."
 KPP_marines_of_kappapolis_title: "Welcome to the Corps!"
 KPP_marines_of_kappapolis_desc: "Amphibious prowess is our strength which not many have. We must train our marines and expand our forces to maximize our advantage against the threats of the kappa."
 KPP_great_amphibious_army_title: "Amphibious Grand Army"
 KPP_great_amphibious_army_desc: "The forces of [Root.GetName] need to act on land and sea with equal levels of efficiency. The Kappa Marine Corps are the perfect unit to excel at both land and naval warfare. However, their numbers are still lacking and their strength still has room for improvements. We should expand the corps even further and embrace special military doctrines."
 KPP_great_amphibious_army_at: "The modifier '§YImproved Marine Training§!' gets upgraded to the following modifier:"
 KPP_great_amphibious_army_bt: "The modifier '§YThe Kappa Marine Corps§!' gets upgraded to the following modifier:"
 KPP_call_the_fleet_title: "Call the Fleet!"
 KPP_call_the_fleet_desc: "The threats to [Root.GetName] are not only from foreign lands. Some of our enemies are just as capable at naval warfare as we are. We must make sure that our navy is large enough to endure their attacks in the future, inevitable wars."
 KPP_break_through_the_barrier_title: "Break through the Barrier"
 KPP_break_through_the_barrier_desc: "Naval warfare might be one of our strong suits, but it pales to the curiosity of the kappa. Gensokyo is but a small place on a planet full of undiscovered wonders. It is our duty as explorers to break through this pesky Hakurei barrier and see what the outworld has to offer."
 KPP_colonial_ambitions_title: "Colonial Ambitions"
 KPP_colonial_ambitions_desc: "Gensokyo is filled with warmongers who want to go after their weaker neighbors. We shall not be like them!\nInstead, the focus of our attention shall be on what lies outside the barrier!"
 KPP_explore_far_west_title: "Explore the Far West"
 KPP_explore_far_west_desc: "The barrier is broken once and for all! Now the chance to see what empires might hide in the far west is in our hands! What potential new technologies and wonderous magic might reveal themselves to us? We have push further west to discover what hides in the unknown."
 KPP_explore_far_west_tt: "Has discovered any province in the §YAfrica§!."
 KPP_discover_europe_title: "Discover Europe"
 KPP_discover_europe_desc: "Gensokyan legends tell about a strange continent settled by humans with very shiny armor and outdated technology who built impressive empires. This \"Europe\" is said to possess many valuable resources. Naturally, these are just legends, but our curiosity dictates us to at least see if there might be a grain of truth."
 KPP_the_ship_of_space_title: "The Space Ship"
 KPP_the_ship_of_space_desc: "Not all residents of Gensokyo are either kappa, ordinary humans or magical youkai. Some special humans have followed the path of a kappa and embraced progress and technology. One of the most extreme cases is Professor Yumemi Okazaki, a great scientific mind who claims to be from the future. Her ship is unlike any we have ever seen before - a marvel of technology. Naturally, it is our duty to find a way to research this ship more properly."
 KPP_the_ship_of_space_at: "§Y[YUM.GetName]§! is either an ally or subject of §Y[Root.GetName]§! and has at least §Y75§! trust of [Root.GetName]."
 KPP_the_ship_of_space_bt: "§Y[YUM.GetName]§! does not exist and §Y[5301.GetName]§! is owned by §Y[Root.GetName]§! or its subjects."
 KPP_the_ship_of_space_ct: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! has an Administrative Techonlogy of §Y7§! and has at least §Y1§! regiment standing in §Y[5301.GetName]§!."
 KPP_colonize_the_cape_title: "Colonize the Cape"
 KPP_colonize_the_cape_desc: "South Africa contains many uncontested gold mines and other valuable resources. It is also a crucial region for the Asian trade flowing into Europe as all the merchants either have to cross the hostile Arabian deserts or sail around the Cape of Good Hope. It goes without saying that the Cape is the perfect spot for a new crown colony of [Root.GetName]."
 KPP_colonize_the_cape_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on the §YCentral Africa§! and the §YCongo§! regions if the missions '§YTake over East Africa§!' and '§YColonize the Horn§!' are already completed."
 KPP_great_army_of_the_republic_title: "Grand Army of the Republic"
 KPP_great_army_of_the_republic_desc: "Our situation is precarious. The lands of the kappa is split between two realms while the Moriya Clan seeks our subjugation. We must create a Grand Army of the Republic to counter our enemies." ##Fumo Fumo Continue Here Fumo##
 KPP_annex_the_mountain_kappas_title: "Annex the Yamawaro"
 KPP_annex_the_mountain_kappas_desc: "The yamawaro are kappa of the mountains - part of our people. However, they try to deny our common kinship. It is our duty as kappa to end this once and for all and take the yamawaro lands for us."

 KPP_construct_kappa_defenses_title: "Construct Kappa Defenses"
 KPP_construct_kappa_defenses_desc: "Our land is surrounded by potential enemies of the kappa. To our north, the demons and their evil goddess Shinki rule over Makai and threatened our existence ever since we can think. To the north east, Senkai, the closed land of the hermits, expressed more than enough interest for kappa territory.\nThe Moriya Clan and the Tengus to our south might have been allies and trade partners in the past, but it is questionable if they truly remain friends of the kappa.\n\nWe are not an offensive people, but it is undeniable that our borders need fortifications."
 KPP_construct_kappa_defenses_ct: "Upgrade the fortification building to the next tech level."
 KPP_genius_of_the_kappa_title: "Engineering Genius"
 KPP_genius_of_the_kappa_desc: "With the knowledge and the support of Rika and Yumemi, the engineers of [Root.GetName] are ready to start their greatest engineering project: the Hisotensoku - a massive robot whish shall be the epitome of engineering genius.\nBut for that we must ensure that we have the necessary technology first."
 KPP_genius_of_the_kappa_ct: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! has a technology difference of at least §Y1§! compared to all known countries.\n§Y[Root.GetAdjective] subject countries do not count.§!"
 KPP_genius_of_the_kappa_tt: "No known country embraced more institutions than §Y[Root.GetName]§!.\n§Y[Root.GetAdjective] subject countries do not count.§!"
 KPP_take_over_east_africa_title: "Gold for the Hardware"
 KPP_take_over_east_africa_desc: "Our technology is limited to mostly steam and fuel based engines. Our engineers want to move on to new a way of technology: electricity! Copper is fortunately no issue in Gensokyo. However, gold, which is easy to use, conductive and resistant to corrosion, is much more difficult to acquire due to the youkai burning desire to keep it for themselves.\nLuckily, the alien continent of Africa has more than enough gold for our purposes."
 KPP_the_lost_tanks_title: "Engines of Destruction"
 KPP_the_lost_tanks_desc: "The human Rika is one of a kind. Instead of all the other friends who practice either magic or live an ordinary life as a peasant, the head engineer of the so called Panzerholics constructs and develops mobile machines for war. The technology is completely foreign in Gensokyo! Naturally, it is our duty to collect this technology for ourselves."
 KPP_the_lost_tanks_at: "§Y[THR.GetName]§! is either an ally or subject of §Y[Root.GetName]§! and has at least §Y75§! trust of [Root.GetName]."
 KPP_the_lost_tanks_bt: "§Y[THR.GetName]§! does not exist and §Y[5148.GetName]§! is owned by §Y[Root.GetName]§! or its subjects."

 KPP_invest_in_the_kappalands_title: "Invest in the Kappalands"
 KPP_invest_in_the_kappalands_desc: "The Kappalands are marshes and fertile farmlands flood with rivers. We should construct workshops and marketplaces first so we can attract the terraformers who are interested in developing these lands."
 KPP_curtail_the_estates_title: "Governmental Re-Focus"
 KPP_curtail_the_estates_desc: "The government of our state is rudimentary at best. Individualism, while not a bad thing on its own, is deeply anchored in every kappa and working with others is only feasible in face of an existential threat. We kappa cannot succeed if our own competitive spirit and our genius keep us separated from each other.\nIt is time that the governmental and cultural spirit of our state see changes."
 KPP_enact_the_first_reform_title: "Reform Kappa Laws"
 KPP_enact_the_first_reform_desc: "The ancestral kappa were few in numbers and our laws from their time show this. The interests of the single kappa is above the interests of all kappa; the designs of inventions is never accepted on the fact alone that they are done by somebody else.\nThese laws are heavily outdated as all the inventions a single kappa can create are already born. The age of the large projects has started and we kappa need to learn to adapt to it. The ancient laws must be reformed!"
 kpp_had_counter_movement_disaster_tt: "Overcame the §YKappa Counter Movement§! disaster."
 KPP_enact_the_second_reform_title: "End the Competitions"
 KPP_enact_the_second_reform_desc: "Our people are geniuses who find easy solutions to complex problems. The issue, however, is that we rarely agree on a single solution and as such two kappa create two different solutions to the same issue, which then result into an escalation of the problem - and this only because of our competitive nature.\nCompetition and individualism are no bad things; they are vital for the colorful personalities of our state. However, the current state of competition is outright dangerous and leads to more internal turmoil than necessary. This has to stop!"
 KPP_enact_the_third_reform_title: "The Kappa Guild Wars"
 KPP_enact_the_third_reform_desc: "The competitions of the individual kappa is no longer a threat to our state stability. However, now entire factions and guild have formed in our country which try to enforce their own demands above the needs of kappa kind. But not only are they enemies of the state but also competitors with other guilds.\nWe must stop the Kappa Guild Wars if we ever want to unify our people."
 kpp_had_guild_wars_disaster_complete_tt: "Overcame the §YKappa Guild Wars§! disaster."
 KPP_unite_the_kappas_for_good_title: "The United Republic"
 KPP_unite_the_kappas_for_good_desc: "It is done. The laws are unified and strictly forbid kappa infightings. Bloody competitions have been tuned down and turned into a contest of the best tinkers and the government received several reforms that the best of the tinkers shall become leader of [Root.GetName]. All what is necessary is the codification of these laws and make them part of our constitution."
 KPP_discover_australia_title: "Discover Australia"
 KPP_discover_australia_desc: "There are myths of an oversized island filled with scary beasts which put even the youkai of Gensokyo to shame. It is said that this island is to the far south of Gensokyo, beyond the Hakurei Barrier. We must find it and secure for kappa kind."
 KPP_discover_australia_tt: "Discover any province in §YAustralia§!."
 KPP_colonize_australia_title: "Colonize Australia"
 KPP_colonize_australia_desc: "This Australia is pure hell. The animals are dangerous and the environment is the opposite of what our people considers as good weather.\nBut not all is lost. Australia might have resources which are of great value. And the lifeforms of this island can be utilized for further field tests. We must press on and colonize Australia."
 KPP_colonize_australia_tt: "Every province in §YAustralia§! which owned by §Y[Root.GetName]§! or its subjects gains §G1§! Base Tax, Base Production and Base Manpower."
 KPP_diplomacy_with_tengus_title: "Tengu Diplomacy"
 KPP_diplomacy_with_tengus_desc: "The tengus of the Youkai Mountain do not trust foreigners and non-tengus alike. However, the tengus are quite fond of our kind ever since we taught them the secrets of printing paper.\nThe current diplomatic position of [Root.GetName] is precarious and isolated. We need to reconnect with the tengus once again so we have a state who is ready to protect us from foreign great powers."
 KPP_diplomacy_with_tengus_tt: "We will request an alliance with §Y[TGU.GetName]§! if they have at least §Y75§! opinion of [Root.GetName].\n\nIf §Y[TGU.GetName]§! is our ally then their opinion of us improves by §G50§!.\n\nIf §Y[TGU.GetName]§! is a §YRival§! or an §YEnemy§! of §Y[Root.GetName]§! then we gain a general (§Y3§!/§Y3§!/§Y4§!/§Y2§!).\n\nIf §Y[TGU.GetName]§! does not exist then we gain §G25§! Prestige (becomes Monarch Power if we already have 100 Prestige)."
 KPP_a_net_of_alliances_title: "A Net of Alliances"
 KPP_a_net_of_alliances_desc: "Gensokyo has become a dangerous place for our people. States and realms have proclaimed their military ambitions on the continent and are more than ready to shed blood for it. We must create a net of alliances, which ensures the security of our kind."
 KPP_a_net_of_alliances_tt: " §YAllies§! have at least §Y150§! total Development."
 KPP_diplomacy_with_moriya_title: "Moriya Diplomacy"
 KPP_diplomacy_with_moriya_desc: "The Moriya Clan is an important customer as they ordered several pieces of technological wonder. They also possess great power in their ability to field armies which seem to not ran out of manpower.\nIt would be wise if we link with the Moriya Clan and either offer them our servitude as a religious tributary or achieve an alliance with them."
 KPP_colonize_peru_title: "Mountain Kappa Colony"
 KPP_colonize_peru_desc: "The Andes are a mountain range in South America rich of gold, silver and other valuable resources. But most importantly: they are the perfect environment for our cousins, the Mountain Kappa. Colonizing the Andes will have the following benefits: we gain access to valuable resources, we have a safe place for the field tests of our gadgets AND we can get rid of the more annoying part of the Mountain Kappa."
 KPP_discover_south_america_title: "New World's Jungles"
 KPP_discover_south_america_desc: "According to fairy explorers, the southern continent of the new world is home to a great river which grants the whole land life. Naturally, our people is attracted to large rivers, vivid jungles and comfortable swamps. We must find this continent and claim it for [Root.GetName]."
 KPP_discover_south_america_tt: "Discover any province in §YSouth America§!."
 KPP_colonize_brazil_title: "Colonize Brazil"
 KPP_colonize_brazil_desc: "The very best of our people deserve the luxurious housings in the New World. The very worst of our people deserve to work for their sins.\nBoth of these groups deserve to be sent to Brazil."
 KPP_secure_defensive_ground_title: "Secure the Castle"
 KPP_secure_defensive_ground_desc: "There is little interaction between the kappa and the inchling. Our people focus on the life at the rivers while the inchlings hide themselves in the miniature Shining Needle Castle.\nHowever, recent hostilities of our neighbors made it necessary for our realm to expand. The Shining Needle Castle is a perfect defensive position."
 KPP_settle_in_the_philippines_title: "Kappa Moluccas"
 KPP_settle_in_the_philippines_desc: "The large group of islands, which carry the name 'Moluccas', is rich of spices. While many, less developed species would take these spices for their meals. However, we see a great potential in them as they could be perfect fuel for our newest inventions."
 KPP_trade_in_malacca_and_moluccas_title: "More Spice for the Engine"
 KPP_trade_in_malacca_and_moluccas_desc: "The spices we collected are just the right amount of hotness. Our engines function with a new found on maximum efficiency. However, we only have a limited access to this valuable fuel. The humans of the Moluccas and Malacca are trying to hide their spices away from us for their \"trade\" and \"families\". We call nonsense on that! They try to deny our progress in sciecne. We must dominate this spice trade so our ships can have the pepper they need."
 KPP_discover_north_america_title: "New World's Highlands"
 KPP_discover_north_america_desc: "It is said that there is a region of highlands and mountains in the center of the New World. While not necessarily our preferred location to settle, the minerals and resources of this region might be be very handy for our engineers. We should discover these lands and see their potential for ourselves."
 KPP_discover_north_america_tt: "Discover any province in §YMexico§! or §YCentral America§!."
 KPP_mexican_trade_posts_title: "Gain Obsidian Access"
 KPP_mexican_trade_posts_desc: "Our engineers have one goal in mind: to make the ships of [Root.GetName] the most robust and dangerous ships on the world. Through their experiments, they learned that a certain new material, obsidian, is what they need to reinforce the hulls of our ships so they stand the heat of battles.\nObsidian, however, is not a resource common in Gensokyo. As such we have to travel to the New World and claim the obsidian for us from the natives."
 KPP_collect_gadgets_1_title: "A Small Step for a Kappa"
 KPP_collect_gadgets_1_desc: "Technology is the life force of our society; of our culture and economy. It is in our best interest to invest in it no matter the cost."

 KPP_collect_gadgets_2_title: "Progress of Kappa-kind"
 KPP_collect_gadgets_2_desc: "Our current state of discovered gadgets impresses the simple minded around us. Yet, that is nowhere near to our true potential. We must develop new gadgets and technologies!"

The wildlife of Australia has caused headaches to our colonists for quite some time.\nThis changes today when our most adventurous engineers travelled to Australia and caught several specimen of Australian animals.
