 ###KPP MISSIONS###
 KPP_docks_of_the_kappas_title: "Centers of Conscriptions"
 KPP_docks_of_the_kappas_desc: "We kappas are no militaristic people. However, it is apparent that our neighbors do not share this sentiment and prepared their military forces.\nWhile our current administration is good enough to recruit an emergency army for our defense, it is by far from being sufficient for raising a counter offensive. We must construction additional centers of conscriptions to change this."
 KPP_marines_of_kappapolis_title: "Welcome to the Corps!"
 KPP_marines_of_kappapolis_desc: "Amphibious prowess is our strength which not many have. We must train our marines and expand our forces to maximize our advantage against the threats of the kappas."

 KPP_great_amphibious_army_desc: "The forces of [Root.GetName] need to act on land and sea with equal levels of efficiency. The Kappa Marine Corps are the perfect unit to excel at both land and naval warfare. However, their numbers are still lacking and their strength still has room for improvements. We should expand the corps even further and embrace special military doctrines."
 KPP_call_the_fleet_title: "Call the Fleet!"
 KPP_call_the_fleet_desc: "The threats to [Root.GetName] are not bound on land only. Some of our enemies are just as adapted to the sea as our people are. We must make sure that our navy is large enough to endure their attacks in the future, inevitable wars."
 KPP_break_through_the_barrier_title: "Break through the Barrier"
 KPP_break_through_the_barrier_desc: "Naval warfare might be one of our strong suits, but it pales to the curiosity of a kappa. Gensokyo is not everything but a small place on a planet full of undiscovered wonders. It is our duty as explorers to break through this pesky Hakurei barrier and see what the outworld has to offer."
 KPP_colonial_ambitions_title: "Colonial Ambitions"
 KPP_colonial_ambitions_desc: "Gensokyo is filled with warmongers who want to go after their weaker neighbors. We shall not be one of them!\nInstead, the focus of our attention shall be on what lies behind the barrier!"

 KPP_explore_far_west_desc: "The barrier is broken once and for all! Now it is in our hands to see what empires might hide in the far west; what potential new technologies and wonderous magics might reveal themselves to us. But to discover it we have to push further west."

 KPP_discover_europe_title: "Discover Europe"
 KPP_discover_europe_desc: "Gensokyan legends tell about a strange continent settled by humans with very shiny armor and backwater technology who built impressive empires. This \"Europe\" is said to possess many valuable resources. Naturally, these are just legends, but our curiosity dictates us to at least see if there might be a grain of truth."
 KPP_trade_with_the_europeans_title: "Trade with the West"
 KPP_trade_with_the_europeans_desc: "The technology of these Europeans is disappointing to say the least. But their trade goods and resources are as fascinating as they are useful to us. We should start to engage with these new found friends in active trade as soon as possible."
 KPP_trade_with_the_europeans_tt: " is a trade node in §YEurope§! in which §Y[Root.GetName]§! has at least §Y5%§! Trade Power."
 KPP_the_ship_of_space_title: "The Space Ship"
 KPP_the_ship_of_space_desc: "Not all residents of Gensokyo are either kappas, ordinary humans or magical youkai. Some special humans have followed the path of a kappa and embraced progress and technology. One of the most extreme cases is Professor Yumemi Okazaki, a great scientific mind who claims to be from the future. Her ship is none we have ever seen - a marvel of technology. We should take over it and study her claims and the science behind this space ship."
 KPP_the_cyber_technology_of_the_future_title: "The Tech of the Future"
 KPP_the_cyber_technology_of_the_future_desc: "Inventions; technology; progress: these are the mantras our civilization lives by. These are the values we strive for. It is our utter highest priority to invent the technology of tomorrow."

 KPP_colonize_the_cape_title: "Colonize the Cape"
 KPP_colonize_the_cape_desc: "South Africa contains many uncontested gold mines and other valuable resources. It is also a crucial region for the Asian trade flowing into Europe as all the merchants either have to cross the hostile Arabian deserts or ship around the Cape of Good Hope. It goes without saying that the Cape is the perfect spot for a new crown colony of [Root.GetName]."
 KPP_colonize_the_cape_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on the §YCentral Africa§! and the §YCongo§! regions if the missions '§YTake over East Africa§!' and '§YColonize the Horn§!' are already completed."
 KPP_great_army_of_the_republic_title: "Grand Army of the Republic"
 KPP_great_army_of_the_republic_desc: "Our situation is precarious. The lands of the kappas is split between two realms while the Moriya Clan seeks our subjugation. We must create a Grand Army of the Republic to counter the increasing threats of our enemies."

 KPP_annex_the_mountain_kappas_desc: "The yamawaro are kappas of the mountains - part of our people. However, they try to deny our common kinship. It is our duty as kappas to end this once and for all and take the yamawaro lands for us."
 KPP_construct_kappa_defenses_title: "Construct Kappa Defenses"
 KPP_construct_kappa_defenses_desc: "Our land is surrounded by potential enemies of the kappas. To our north, the demons and their evil goddess Shinki rule over Makai and threatened our existence ever since we can think. To the north east, Senkai, the closed land of the hermits, expressed more than enough interest for kappa territory.\nThe Moriya Clan and the Tengus to our south might have been allies and trade partners in the past, but it is questionable if they truly remain friends of the kappa.\n\nWe are not an offensive people, but it is undeniable that our borders need fortifications."
 KPP_tinkers_federation_title: "The Tinker Federation"
 KPP_tinkers_federation_desc: "We kappas are renowned for our engineering, inventions, tinkering and affinity for science. But we are not alone in Gensokyo as there are two human states which rival us in our genius: the Time Travelers from the future, led by Yumemi Okazaki, and the tinkers of the Panzerholics under Rika. As fellow enlightened minds it is our duty to unify our three states into one federation under our banner."
 KPP_greatest_technology_title: "Hisoutensoku Project"
 KPP_greatest_technology_desc: "The technological progress of our country is unquestionable; our inventions and machines can vouch for it.\nYet, there is still one task our engineers did not manage to complete yet. It is no secret that we kappas are the target of many who cannot understand our genius and as such we are at constant danger. The Hisoutensoku Project shall put an end to the worries of the kappas once and for all. But in order to accomplish our goals we will require a lot more resources and money."
 KPP_push_to_africa_title: "Push to Africa"
 KPP_push_to_africa_desc: "Rumors tell about a vast continent on the way to the far west. \"Africa\" - that's how some of the humans have called it. Little is actually known about this Africa though. We must know what these rumors are all about and find this infamous land."

 KPP_take_over_east_africa_title: "Take over East Africa"
 KPP_take_over_east_africa_desc: "Ivory is not foreign to us Gensokyan. However, the little bit of ivory we have is precious and is only used for the highest of quality jewelry. Meanwhile, East Africa seems to be flooded with animals who have this desired good literally in their face. We should take over East Africa and make sure that we have a good access to these \"elephants\"."
 KPP_take_over_east_africa_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on the §YCentral Africa§! and the §YCongo§! regions if the missions '§YColonize the Cape§!' and '§YColonize the Horn§!' are already completed."
 KPP_scramble_for_africa_title: "Scramble for Africa"
 KPP_scramble_for_africa_desc: "Our discovery and colonization of Africa did not go unnoticed. Gensokyan rivals and even great powers from Europe are trying to compete with us for the conquest of Africa. While North Africa is fairly outside our range, it is imperative that we annex everything south of the Congo Basin."
 KPP_the_lost_tanks_title: "Engines of Destruction"
 KPP_the_lost_tanks_desc: "The human Rika is one of a kind. Instead of all the other friends who practice either magic or live an ordinary life as a peasant, the head engineer of the so called Panzerholics constructs and develops mobile machines for war. The technology is completely foreign in Gensokyo! Naturally, it is our duty to collect this technology for ourselves."
 KPP_cybernetical_engeineering_title: "Cybernetical Engineering"
 KPP_cybernetical_engeineering_desc: "Defensive wars; explorations; engineering - all of these activities are common places for kappas to lose precious body parts. These poor members of our society are unable to act for their own.\nThis is unacceptable! A kappa must not be hold back by its flesh! We shall develop artificial replacements for the missing parts so progress will not stop when one of our kind loses their arm."
 KPP_colonize_the_horn_title: "Colonize the Horn"
 KPP_colonize_the_horn_desc: "Coffee is not foreign to the people of Gensokyo. The yamaxanadu, the tengus and the kappas in particular have a high demand for this energetic drink. However, none of the provinces in Gensokyo are really feasible for coffee bean farms.\nThe Horn of Africa on the other has several spots where these desired beans grow and thrive. We should colonize it for the sake of our coffee consumption."
 KPP_colonize_the_horn_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on the §YCentral Africa§! and the §YCongo§! regions if the missions '§YColonize the Cape§!' and '§YTake over East Africa§!' are already completed."

 KPP_curtail_the_estates_title: "Governmental Re-Focus"
 KPP_curtail_the_estates_desc: "The government of our state is rudimentary at best. Individualism, while not a bad thing on its own, is deeply anchored in every kappa and working with others is only feasible in face of an existential threat. We kappas cannot succeed if our own competitive spirit and our genius keep us separated from each other.\nIt is time that the governmental and cultural spirit of our state see changes."
 KPP_enact_the_first_reform_title: "Reform Kappa Laws"
 KPP_enact_the_first_reform_desc: "The ancestral kappas were few in numbers and our laws from their time show this. The interests of the single kappa is above the interests of all kappas; the designs of inventions is never accepted on the fact alone that they are done by somebody else.\nThese laws are heavily outdated as all the inventions a single kappa can create are already born. The age of the large projects has started and we kappas need to learn to adapt to it. The ancient laws must be reformed!"
 kpp_had_counter_movement_disaster_tt: "Overcame the §YKappa Counter Movement§! disaster."
 KPP_enact_the_second_reform_title: "End the Competitions"
 KPP_enact_the_second_reform_desc: "Our people are geniuses who find easy solutions to complex problems. The issue, however, is that we rarely agree on a single solution and as such two kappas create two different solutions to the same issue, which then result into an escalation of the problem - and this only because of our competitive nature.\nCompetition and individualism are no bad things; they are vital for the colorful personalities of our state. However, the current state of competition is outright dangerous and leads to more internal turmoil than necessary. This has to stop!"
 kpp_had_anti_teamwork_coalition_disaster_tt: "Overcame the §YKappa Anti-Teamwork Coalition§! disaster."
 KPP_enact_the_third_reform_title: "The Kappa Guild Wars"
 KPP_enact_the_third_reform_desc: "The competitions of the individual kappa is no longer a threat to our state stability.

But not only are they enemies of the state but also competitors with other guilds.\nWe must stop the Kappa Guild Wars if we ever want to unify our people."
 kpp_had_guild_wars_disaster_complete_tt: "Overcame the §YKappa Guild Wars§! disaster."
 KPP_unite_the_kappas_for_good_title: "The United Republic"
 KPP_unite_the_kappas_for_good_desc: "It is done. The laws are unified and strictly forbid kappa infightings. Bloody competitions have been tuned down and turned into a contest of the best tinkers and the government received several reforms that the best of the tinkers shall become leader of [Root.GetName]. All what is necessary is the codification of these laws and make them part of our constitution."
 KPP_discover_australia_title: "Discover Australia"
 KPP_discover_australia_desc: "There are myths of an oversized island filled with scary beasts which put even the youkai of Gensokyo to shame. It is said that this island is to the far south of Gensokyo, beyond the Hakurei Barrier. We must find it and secure for kappa kind."
 KPP_discover_australia_tt: "Discover any province in §YAustralia§!."
 KPP_colonize_australia_title: "Colonize Australia"
 KPP_colonize_australia_desc: "This Australia is pure hell. The animals are dangerous and the environment is the opposite of what our people considers as good weather.\nBut not all is lost. Australia might have resources which are of great value. And the lifeforms of this island can be utilized for further field tests. We must press on and colonize Australia."
 KPP_colonize_australia_tt: "Every province in §YAustralia§! which owned by §Y[Root.GetName]§! or its subjects gains §G1§! Base Tax, Base Production and Base Manpower."
 KPP_weaponize_australian_wildlife_title: "Weaponize Wildlife"
 KPP_weaponize_australian_wildlife_desc: "The animals of Australia have caused much grief to our colonizers. However, they possess great potential nonetheless. We should station a battalion in Australia and try to catch as many of these beasts as possible so we can use them as future weapons for the [Root.GetAdjective] Arsenal."
 KPP_weaponize_australian_wildlife_tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! has stationed an army of §Y25§! infantry regiments in any province in §YAustralia§!."

 flavor_kpp.1.desc.b: "It is once again time for elections in [Root.GetName]. As it is tradition, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to abdicate so another kappa can try to keep the highly competitive kappas of [Root.GetName] together. The following three primary candidates have been nominated..."

 flavor_kpp.3.t: "The Kappa Marine Corps"
 flavor_kpp.3.desc: "The kappas of Gensokyo were always a peaceful people, trying to create new inventions and earn some money on the markets of the Human Capital. Warfare, while not foreign, was never a big concern.\nBut Gensokyo has changed. Clans and realms have risen to power and are now attempting to spread their influence by force. [Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and an elected ruler of the kappas, has reorganized the military of [Root.GetName] and introduced a new reform which shall play into the amphibious strengths of the kappas.\nThe Kappa Marine Corps are born."

Nitori's task is not an easy one as three of the four at this table lost their territory to [Root.GetName] in previous conflicts. Yet, Nitori is not one who backs down from a challenge.\n\nAfter several hours of arguments, designing and scrapping contracts and negotiating, Nitori finally managed to get the [Root.GetAdjective] goals through: the unification of the engineers under [Root.GetAdjective] banner.\nReluctantly, all three agreed to accept the conditions and are now official part of the [Root.GetAdjective] Tinker Federation."

Though it's not the most exciting inside from an aesthetic point of view, the many screens, buttons and levers break the visual monotony.\nOur brightest minds worked day after day to reverse-engineer the technology - without success. But their work is not completely futile as they managed to recreate the weapon systems of the ship and integrated them into our arsenal of available gadgets."
 flavor_kpp.9.a: "At least these Aerial Torpedos are our efforts worth."
 flavor_kpp.10.t: "The Tanks of Rika"
 flavor_kpp.10.desc: "The subjugation of the Panzerholics gave us access to their mobile artillery - and it beyond what any kappa could have imagine from human technologies. Several tons heavy and with incomprehensible firepower, the \"tanks\" of the Panzerholics are the great human weapon to surpass the Gensokyan magic."
 flavor_kpp.10.a: "These tanks will make a fine addition to our arsenal."
 flavor_kpp.11.t: "Kappa Cybernetics"
 flavor_kpp.11.desc: "Wars and battles come with their toll. Arms; legs; entire body sections - these all are easily lost in the heat of combat and the surviving kappas are rendered crippled for the rest of their lives.\nOr at least in the past it was the case. Kappa engineers developed artificial limbs and body parts which allow our soldiers to continue the fight against the enemies of kappa kind even after losing everything but their lives."
 flavor_kpp.11.a: "Kappa science is the greatest of the world!"
 flavor_kpp.12.t: "Fly! Sanpai Fight"
 flavor_kpp.12.desc: "\"Fly! Sanpai Fight\" - the newest breakthrough in kappa technology. Although its name raised many eyebrows of veteran kappa engineers, the idea undoubtedly convinced even the most conservative tinker. Through the usage of the advanced technology of the space ship, the brilliant minds of our [Root.GovernmentName] designed a jetpack for the usual kappa, which allows them to move over difficult terrain with relative ease. No longer has any kappa have to walk into the battlefield on foot - and best the best thing about them is their reliability! Even under heavy fire, the Fly! Sanpai Fight jetpack remains functional and safe for usage."
 flavor_kpp.12.a: "I bet these mountain kappas would have not cared about user safety!"
 flavor_kpp.13.t: "The Hisoutensoku Robot"
 flavor_kpp.13.desc: "Hisoutensoku is a giant robot which was originally designed to be used for advertising for the Moriya Shrine. [Root.GetAdjective] engineers repurposed the robot, however, and reworked it into a large machine of destruction and power for the great army of the republic."
 flavor_kpp.13.a: "Nobody can defeat us with Hisoutensoku on our side!"
 flavor_kpp.20.t: "Test Field Breakthrough: Nitori's Gadgets"
 flavor_kpp.20.desc: "Nitori has made great progress on the test field with her newest quality of life gadget. This will improve the life standard of the citizens of our [Root.GovernmentName] as well as inspire new tinkers with a new desire for pursuing innovative ideas."
 flavor_kpp.20.a: "Astounding!"

 flavor_kpp.23.a: "Astounding!"
 flavor_kpp.30.t: "Kappa Competitors rise in [th_kappa_rebellion_province.GetName]"
 flavor_kpp.30.desc: "Elections are always an explosive topic for kappas. The majority of our population believes that there is nobody but them who is genius enough to rule them.\nAs a result of this mindset, the election of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] caused large outcry in [th_kappa_rebellion_province.GetName]. The local kappas have been rallied under the banner of a competitor, who believes to do [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s job better."
 flavor_kpp.30.a: "It's treason then."
 flavor_kpp.40.t: "[Root.GetName]'s Reforms"
 flavor_kpp.40.desc: "The unwillingness to cooperate has been a thorn in the side for many [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s of [Root.GetName]. Their recent revolts after every election, however, was the final straw.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName], enacted the first reforms which shall be the first step into a united Kappa State."
 flavor_kpp.40.a: "We kappas have to work together if we want to survive."

 flavor_kpp.41.t: "Kappa Counter Movement"
 flavor_kpp.41.desc: "The rule over the kappas has always been disorganized at best and bloody chaos at the very least. Due to the competitiveness of the kappas, every election results into an uprising unless the elected tinker has proven themselves in the eyes of the public in the past - which is tricky if the only way to prove themselves is by ruling the kappas in the first place.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] recognized the flaws of such governing system and introduced new laws which target the constant uprisings at every election. But these laws don't come with repercussions. Overly competitive and egocentric engineers saw themselves challenged and declared themselves as enemy of the state until these laws are revoked."
 flavor_kpp.41.a: "Dark times are ahead..."
 flavor_kpp.42.t: "End of the Kappa Counter Movement"
 flavor_kpp.42.desc: "The Counter Movement has been defeated. Those who opposed have either left the country or managed to abandon their stoic views. [Root.GetName] is finally in a stable time once again."
 flavor_kpp.42.a: "Finally. The [Root.GovernmentName] can heal now."
 flavor_kpp.43.t: "Kappa Anti-Teamwork Coalition"
 flavor_kpp.43.desc: "The people of [Root.GetName] are legendary for their genius mind. Able to find problems to mechanical or scientific issues in mere minutes, the kappas are the smartest of all Gensokyo. However, this genius is our own detriment as no kappa is ever willing to work with another, thinking that the other engineer is a fool.\nThe new laws of promoting teamwork over egoistical tinkering rubbed many of our kind the wrong way. Outraged kappas organized themselves into the so called \"Kappa Anti-Teamwork Coalition\". Completely oblivious to the irony of their actions, this group of radical free thinker work together in order to sabotage the current government's economy."
 flavor_kpp.43.a: "These fools! Do they not see the folly of their ways?"
 flavor_kpp.44.t: "End of the Anti-Teamwork Coalition"
 flavor_kpp.44.desc: "The Anti-Teamwork Coalition has been shattered. Their attempts to bring ruin to our economy were one big fiasco and [Root.GetName] is stronger than ever."
 flavor_kpp.44.a: "And we achieved this by working together."
 flavor_kpp.45.t: "Kappa Guild Wars"
 flavor_kpp.45.desc: "Through reforms, promotions and disasters, the people of [Root.GetName] finally learned the lesson of working together. However, in a twist of intentions and events the kappas of [Root.GetName] formed guilds within the state. Each one of these has their focus on some other great topic of the kappas and as such try to outcompete each other. But one thing is for sure: all three factions seek the destruction of the current republic if it brings benefits to them.\nA coup against [Root.Monarch.GetName] has started in [Root.Capital.GetName]..."

 flavor_kpp.46.t: "End of the Guild Wars"
 flavor_kpp.46.desc: "The guilds have been defeated and dissolved. Their assets have been confiscated and the [Root.GovernmentName] has been restored once more.\nOur people are tired of the constant strife and competitions and made [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the first elected tinker of [Root.GetName]. The kappas are now unified at long last."
 flavor_kpp.46.a: "From this day forward, no kappa shall harm another kappa."
 flavor_kpp.47.t: "[kpp_autonomy_province.GetName] demands Autonomy"
 flavor_kpp.47.desc: "The recent chaos made one of our provinces rebellious. They do not support the law changes, but they promise to be less vocal about it as long they are granted additional autonomy."

 flavor_kpp.48.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s Authority in Question"
 flavor_kpp.48.desc: "The laws to forbid constant uprisings at every election caused great unrest in our country. Opportunists and competitors question the authority of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and wish for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] public execution. Of course the reasonable kappas of the state do not agree with these lunatics. Still, the loud majority causes a serious threat to the safety of the state."

 flavor_kpp.48.b: "Silence them. By force if necessary."
 flavor_kpp.49.t: "Conservative Overreaction"

 flavor_kpp.50.a: "That's just a scratch to our image."
 flavor_kpp.50.b: "We must repair these factories as soon as possible!"
 flavor_kpp.51.t: "Theft of the Treasury"
 flavor_kpp.51.desc: "The \"Super Capitalists\" managed to break into our treasury and stole several tons of gold. They use this money to buy \"doge coins\".\nOur awe of their awareness of the European merchant guilds is only overshadowed by our blinding rage for their audacity."

 flavor_kpp.52.desc: "Ex soldiers of our state formed a so called \"Independent Marines\" faction. Apparently, they try to avoid any kind of active service by bribing any state official they can find.
