###Events###
th_outside_world_decision_events.1.t: "The Dragon speaks"
th_outside_world_decision_events.1.desc: "Cheers and song fill the air as the feast proceeded as planned but when [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] steps outside the castle, lighting suddenly splits the skies, settings clouds and heaven ablaze, turning day to night as a huge and monstrous beast emerged from the fiery hell, a dragon. Guests and guards alike run in all directions, fleeing for their lives but none can escape the beast's gaze. Its voice booming like thunder, defeaning all in attendence except our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. "The boundary has collapsed", the dragon spoke slow and heavy, "demons and gods alike flood into this world to conquer and destroy it. Will you hide away and pray for their goodwill, that they may spare your miserable existence if you simply surrender all that you have to them? Or will you be the one to take up your sword and slay them, defending your home and kin?""

th_immortal_ruler_tt: "§Y[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] will be reborn as an immortal.§!\nIf there are open personality slots, there will be a small chance for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to receive legendary traits"

th_outside_world_decision_events.2.t: "On the Question of Religion"
th_outside_world_decision_events.2.desc: "Ever since we first established contact with shrines of the so called fantasy religions, our realm has been flooded with countless Shrine Maidens attempting to make a case for their faiths and living gods. Until recently this was hardly worth our attention as they stuck to villages in irrelevant regions of the country. However, it seems that they have now decided to directly petition our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The only problem is that seemingly all of these many religious groups had this same idea at once and we are now faced with a bunch of religious figures throwing books and stones at each other in front of our capital, all demanding to be heard by us. Whose side shall we take?"
