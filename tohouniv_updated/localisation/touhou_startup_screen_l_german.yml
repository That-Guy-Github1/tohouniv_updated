 string_start_tag_gensokyo: "The magical continent of §YGensokyo§! - a land of fantasy and myths. One day a group of sages decided to create a land, which is designed for the mystical youkai kind. As such, they used their powers to emerge a massive island out of the ocean. The Japanese then noticed this development and settled on this new, strange land alongside the youkai. After over a century, the sages created the legendary Hakurei Barrier to keep new humans out and the youkai in Gensokyo to protect both species from each other.\n\nDuring this time, many clans, countries, realms and even whole dimensions have formed within the barrier. The oldest being §YHakurei Clan§!, §YMima's Empire§!, §YSunflower Fields§! and §YMakai§!. However, during the events of the §Ypre-Danmaku Era§!, many new faces have shown up in Gensokyo such as §YMayohiga§!, §YTengu Realm§!, §YHigan§!, §YChireiden§! and many more. After the end of the era, the Hakurei Clan moved to the south east, leaving only Meira and the §YHakurei Claimers§! behind, who still hold onto the old Shinto Traditions.\n\nBut peace was of short-lived as the many new Gensokyan realms are gathering their strenth to fulfil their ambitions and goals.\n\nThe inner conflicts are however only the tip. On the verge of the §YAge of Discovery§!, the Hakurei Barrier cracked and broke apart. For the first time in centuries, Gensokyo and its many magical residents are exposed to the human §YOutworld§! and even the §YMoon§!.\n\nGensokyo and the whole Outworld are on the verge of changes no human or youkai could have ever forseen. It is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to lead [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people through this worrisome time and bring [Root.GetName] into a prosperous future."
 string_start_tag_moon: "The Moon is subject to many myths, legends and rumors. What very few people know is that these myths are based on real facts. The Moon is home to the prideful §YLunar Capital§!, the realm of the mysterious, coldhearted and cruel §YLunarian§!. These humanoids were once followers and relatives of Lord Tsukuyomi, the Moon God of the ancient Shinto faith.\n\nThe lunarians prefer the peace of isolation and to stay away from the impurity which is Earth. After an invasion of the Moon through §YYukari§! and her forces, the lunarians increased their defenses and made their home invincible.\n\nBut overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer. The young lunarian princess §YKaguya Houraisan§! committed the sacrilege of ordering Eirin creating the Hourai Potion. She drank it, making her immortal - and breaking Lunarian laws. For her crimes, Kaguya has been banished.\nAdditionally, the lunarian §YChang'e§! provoked the wrath of a merciless mother and her companions. In an act of vengeance, the §YPurifiers§!, §YDream Hell§! and §YClownpiecia§! landed on the moon and slaughtered lunarians to the thousands in the hope of forcing Chang'e out of her hiding.\n\nLastly, the Hakurei Barrier, which kept Gensokyo away from the Outworld as well as the Moon from Earth, has been broken. Not only are the lunarians facing the hatred of §YJunko§! but also the impurity of the Earthlings.\n\nThe fate of the Moon is now in [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s and the [Root.GetAdjective] hands."
