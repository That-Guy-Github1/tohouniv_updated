The Directory Select button will allow you to select the directory of the mod you want to edit preferably https://github.com/Touhou-Universalis/tohouniv_updated/tree/ability_expansion. 
The Validator will confirm that all required files and directories are present.

IF THE VALIDATOR COMPLAINS ABOUT ANY FILE IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO PROCEED. Doing so will require the manual copy and pasting of files later on.

The Submit button will create any missing files and confirm the directory selected and open the editing gui.


Within the Editing Gui the three Sound Buttons is where you can select your sound files, upon submitting they will be copied from their current location to the proper sound file within the mod folder.

The “Name” text field is meant to be displayed in title case and how it is desired to look in the Localization file. For example “Magic Missile” is the preferred formatting but others will work as long as they do not feature any non digit, letter or space characters.

The “Desc” button opens a larger text area to write a description, closing the window will not save any changes unless save was pressed

The “Icon” Button allows you to select the icon from anywhere on any drive like the sound files and will paste the file in the proper directory.

Slot is which button within the danmaku ui the ability will occupy

THE OUTPUT BUTTON WILL IMMEDIATELY OUTPUT AND EDIT THE NECESSARY FILES, SO IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT A BACKUP IS TAKEN SEMI REGULARLY TO PREVENT ERRONEOUS DATA FROM ENTERING. 

The rest i believe to be relatively self evident but if any issues are had or you have requests for additional features, my dms are open
